# Which L2-Calculations do you want to calculate?
# Format is: L2Calculations(n) for a total of n calculations
# then in the next lines, you write which component of the vector shall be used
# for the calculation
# if you want to calculate only the L2-Norm of 1 function, set the other one to the
# component -1.
# Example: If you want to calculate ||f1(1) - f2(1)|| and ||f1(2)|| then take this one
# (with fk(j) beeing component j of vector k)
# L2Calculations(2)=
# 1 1
# 2 -1
# Small note: If both components shall be used,
# the tri-file of function 1 is used to create the
# cubature information

# on which region do you want to calculate the L2-Norm?
# format L2RegionOfInterest(n) for n calculations in total
# in the next n lines you write expressions.
# The expression has to return 1 on the area where we want 
# to calculate. (Typicall: If-Statement)
# Supported variables: x,y (y - obviously - only in 2D)
# The expression in line i is used for calculation i.
# Everything that is supported by the
# function parser is allowed.
#Example: First calculation only where x>0.5 holds
# Second calculation where x<0.6 holds
# hint: you can also set the expression to 1
# L2RegionOfInterest(2)=
# IF(x>0.5,1,0) 
# IF(x<0.6,1,0)
# Note that this must be a subdomain of the tri-file used for
# generating the cubature information and that for every
# point in this subdomain, both functions must(!) have valid values!
# else it is not possible to evaluate the function

L2RegionOfInterest(4)=
IF(x>0.5,1,0) 
IF(x>0.6,1,0)
IF(x>0.7,1,0)
IF(x<0.5,1,0)

# Which cubature rule shall be used for calculation i?
# format is same as above. Keep in mind that the cubature
# rule must be defined for this dimension, ie it is obviously not
# possible to use a 1D-rule for a 2D-integral.

# Where do you want to evaluate which function?
# Format: (n evaluations)
# evaluationPoints(n)= 
# a b c d x y
# with
# a: component of function 1
# b derivative of component a of function 1
# c: component of function 2
# d derivative of component a of function 2
# x y: coordinates of the Point - for 1D only x, for 2d x and y
# if you set both components to a value > 0 then it will calculate
# DER1 f1_a(x,y) - DER2 f2_c(x,y)
# if you set i.e. comp. 2 to -1 it will evaluate DER f1_a at (x,y)
# Valid values for b and d:
# 0: No derivatives, take the function
# 1: Take the derivative w.r.t. x
# 2: Take the derivative w.r.t. y
# Note that even if you don't use i.e a
# component of the first function,
# you must set some value for b
# example: calculate the difference between
# (d/dx)f1_1 and (d/dx) f2_1 in point (0.05,0.05)
# and evaluate the x-derivative of f2_1 in (1.7,0.3)
