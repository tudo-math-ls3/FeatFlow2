 !<constant block>
 ! This block defines all constants used in the ExtFEcomparer
 ! Used for dimension/type of input/...

 ! Dimension
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_NDIM1 = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_NDIM2 = 2
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_NDIM3 = 3

  ! These are the possibilities to write out with
  ! vecio_writeBlockVectorHR, we want to read them in
  ! so we need the types.
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_formatted_unsorted = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_unformatted_unsorted = 2
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_formatted_sorted = 3
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_unformatted_sorted = 4

  ! Another input way is without the routine. For that we need
  ! to know if the file is formatted or unformatted
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_formatted = 5
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_unformatted = 6

  ! "Vector type": like i.e. cc2d (u,v,p) where we read in the
  ! solution of the system without "postprocessing"
  ! or flagship-style - which calculates in the conservative variables
  ! but can write out variables that are not-conservative
  ! (or, in other words: ExtFE_isSolutionBlockvector means
  ! that it is written out with vecio_writeBlockVectorHR)
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_isPostprocessed = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_isSolutionBlockvector = 2

  ! What kind of elements did you use?
  ! An element pair (like in cc2d) -
  ! where you have one element for the speed
  ! and a different one for the pressure
  ! or did you use one element for everything?
  ! Or is the input a list?
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_OneElement = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_ElementPair = 2
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_ElementList = 3

  ! For the sake of readability
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_DO = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_DONT = 0

  ! We need to do point evaluations, but also in the
  ! Derivatives. These ones are to translate the
  ! input to the global constants.
  ! Attention: Function is always zero, x-deriv always 1,
  ! y-deriv always 2 and z-deriv always 3
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_DER_FUNC_1D = 0

  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_DER_DERIV_3D_Z = 3

  ! We have 3 derivatives + the function itself, so
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_NumDerivs = 4

  ! Some day (if used in 3d) we might find out
  ! that the SYS_STRLEN of 256 is not long enough
  ! to read in expressions for ChiOmega
  ! and store them.
  ! So we define an own constant here. At the moment
  ! we keep it at the SYS_STRLEN, but if we find out
  ! that this is not long enough we only need to change
  ! this constant here and still all dependencies
  ! and arithmetics work.
  ! It might become relevant in the output/postprocessing
  ! routines at first
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_STRLEN = SYS_STRLEN

  ! Constants for the UCD-Output
  ! UCD-Types supported
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_UCD_VTK = 1

  ! which way to add a component?
  ! Vertex-Based?
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_UCD_VERT_BASED = 1
  ! Element based?

  ! Translation of the input of ucd-flags
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_UCD_OUT_STANDARD = 1
  integer, parameter, public :: ExtFE_UCD_OUT_DISCONTINUOUS = 2

  ! To generate UCD-Output of the functions, we have to
  ! project the solution vector on a Q1 or Q0 space as
  ! most programs don't understand other formats.
  ! These constants are used during the input and calculation
  ! for this sake

! This is our global "Problem-Structure". However, this name
! is not really good, better would be "wannabe-FEM-Function":
! It collects all information that is necessary to reconstruct
! a FEM-Function, and then the coefficent vector in the end
! will be a FEM-function

  type t_problem

    ! We need a parameterlist for sure
   type(t_parlist) :: rparamlist

   ! How often was the mesh refined?
   ! nRefinements would be a better name, but
   ! it is called NLMAX in most applications I saw so
   ! I kept the name
   integer:: NLMAX

   ! We need the triangulation
   type(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation

   ! and the discretisation
   type(t_blockDiscretisation) :: rdiscretisation

   ! The Type of elements
   ! Either an ID telling which element pair/triple/... was used...
   integer:: iElemPairID
   ! Or the ID of an element that was used for all variables
   ! of the FEM-Function
   integer(I32) :: ielemType
   ! Or we have a list of elements.
   ! Entry i belongs to variable i
   integer(I32), dimension(:), pointer :: iElemList => NULL()

   ! An object for saving the domain:
   type(t_boundary) :: rboundary

   !We also save the vector in here
   type(t_vectorBlock) :: coeffVector

   ! We need the path of the vector and the parametrisation
   character(LEN=ExtFE_STRLEN) :: sPRMFile, sTRIFile
   character(LEN=ExtFE_STRLEN) :: sVectorFile

   ! Dimension of the problem
   integer :: iDimension

   ! We need to know what kind of file we will get to be able
   ! to read it in the correct way
   ! One of these constants:
   ! ExtFE_formatted_unsorted, ExtFE_unformatted_unsorted,
   ! ExtFE_formatted_sorted,   ExtFE_unformatted_sorted,
   ! ExtFE_formatted,          ExtFE_unformatted
   integer :: vectorFileFormat

   ! We need more info to read it correct:
   ! Is it written out with vecio_writeBlockVectorHR
   ! or in the other format? One of these constants:
   ! ExtFE_isPostprocessed, ExtFE_isSolutionBlockvector
   integer :: vectorType

   ! Element pair or one Element?
   ! One of these constants:
   ! ExtFE_OneElement, ExtFE_ElementPair
   integer :: elementSetting

   ! How many Variables are in the Vector?
   ! This is not the number of equations - in cc2d
   ! it would be 3 as we have u,v and p as variables!
   ! Because we always create first the discretisation and
   ! then the vector according to it (as else we cannot
   ! guarantee that all variables in the vector are set correct)
   ! we need this information in advance
   integer :: NVAR

  end type


 ! This is our "postprocessing structure".
 ! It got the name because it saves all information what
 ! we actually want to do with our 2 FEM-Functions.
 ! During the init, it shall get everything that is
 ! possible, to be precise it shall get everything
 ! but the results.
 ! It is also handed over to the calculation routine
 ! as it has all information what we want to calculate.
 ! After that, it goes to the postprocessing routine
 ! where the results are postprocessed
 ! Postprocessed includes every bit of file i/o,
 ! so even writing out the original FEM-Functions in
 ! an other format is considered postprocessing and thus
 ! done in the postprocessing routines
 ! We make heavily use of the handle-system provided by
 ! the Featflow2 storage system. Storing an integer
 ! and "creating a pointer from it" where needed
 ! is easier and cheaper than sending the whole structure
 ! (with the according arrays instead of handles)
 ! through the code as it gets rather big

  ! Intial all values are those that most likely
  ! a) produce an error
  ! b) do not trigger any computation
  ! c) are empty

    integer :: h_L2CompFunc = ST_NOHANDLE
    ! For the Output we want print on which domain we
    ! calculated. h_L2ChiOmega stores the handle to a

    ! We need to pass the characteristic function
    ! somehow to the callback routine that actually

    integer :: h_PointFuncComponents = ST_NOHANDLE

    ! We want to be able to do UCD-Output of the mesh
    ! and of the functions itself.

    ! is the x/y/z-component of that vector
    ! Note: For every vector, all components have to be set! That is, if

    ! part of a vector as specified above) are listed.
    ! Size: iScalarVars
    ! for CC2D, 1 and 2 would be in the vector list
