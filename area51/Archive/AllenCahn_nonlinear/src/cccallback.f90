!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the cc2d-mini problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Stokes
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Pressure
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the pressure matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_x
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the X-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) coeff_RHS_y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Y-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 4.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_X
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in X-direction.
!#     -> Is used for setting up the initial solution.
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetX.
!#
!# 5.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_Y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in Y-direction.
!#     -> Is used for setting up the initial solution.
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetY.
!#
!# 6.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_P
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired pressure.
!#     -> Is used for setting up the initial solution.
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetP.
!#
!# 7.) ffunction_TargetX
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in X-direction.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 8.) ffunction_TargetY
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in Y-direction.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 9.) ffunction_TargetP
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired pressure.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 10.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#
!# 11.) getBoundaryValuesFBC
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the fictitious boundary components
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_fbcassembly.inc'
!#
!# 12.) cc_initCollectForAssembly
!#     -> Is called prior to the assembly process.
!#     -> Stores some information from the problem structure to a collection
!#        such that it can be accessed in callback routines
!#
!# 13.) cc_doneCollectForAssembly
!#      -> Is called after the assembly process.
!#      -> Releases information stored in the collection by
!#         cc_initCollectForAssembly.
!#
!# For nonstationary simulation, it might be neccessary in these routines
!# to access the current simulation time. Before the assembly process, the cc2d
!# framework calls cc_initCollectForAssembly to stores the current point
!# in time (and probably other necessary information) to the quickaccess-array
!# in the collection which is passed to the callback routines. The callback
!# routines can access this as follows:
!#
!# -> rcollection%IquickAccess(1)   = 0: stationary,
!#                                    1: nonstationary with explicit time stepping
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(1)   = current simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(2)   = minimum simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(3)   = maximum simulation time
!#
!# After the assembly, cc_doneCollectForAssembly is called to clean up.
!# Note: Information stored in the quick-access array are of temporary
!# nature and does not have to be cleaned up.
