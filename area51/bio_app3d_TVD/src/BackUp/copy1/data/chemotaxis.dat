# E.g. setting NLMAX = 4 actually leads to a 3 times refinement.
# Since we calculate on an already once refined mesh, e.g. our 
# initial mesh looks like this

# The equation reads as follows:
#
#       d/dt u = D_1 * Laplace u - CHI*grad *(u * grad c) + f 
#       d/dt c = D_2 * Laplace c - ALPHA*u*c + BETA*u + g
