# This is the data file for the scalar heat equation
# equation of the problem AllenCahn
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The 'equation' section configures the different constants in the equation.
#
# The equation reads as follows:
#
#   d/dt u  - div ( alpha*grad(u) )  +  beta*grad(u)  +  gamma*u  =  f
#
# with
#
#  u = u(x,t)
#
#  f = f(x,t) as defined in heatcond_callback.f90
#
#  alpha = ( alpha11 alpha12 )
#          ( alpha21 alpha22 )
#
#  beta  = ( beta1 )
#          ( beta2 )
#
#  and the scalar parameter gamma.
