# Flux values

# Calculate the flux through one or multilple lines.
# The number in braces "(n)" defines the number of lines where to
# evaluate the flux. Afterwards follows a list of points in the
# format
#   "x-start y-start x-end y-end"
# that defines the starting and ending point of the line.
#
# Example: Don't evaluate anything:
#   cevaluateFluxValues(0) =
#
# Example: Evaluate the flux through the line (0.5,0.5)->(0.5,0.0)
#   cevaluateFluxValues(1) =
#     0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0

cevaluateFluxValues(0) =

# Whether to write the point values to a file

iwriteFluxValues = 0

# Filename for the point values
