  !<description>
    ! This subroutine is called during the vector assembly. It has to compute
    ! the coefficients in front of the terms of the linear form.
    !
    ! The routine accepts a set of elements and a set of points on these
    ! elements (cubature points) in in real coordinates.
    ! According to the terms in the linear form, the routine has to compute
    ! simultaneously for all these points and all the terms in the linear form
    ! the corresponding coefficients in front of the terms.
