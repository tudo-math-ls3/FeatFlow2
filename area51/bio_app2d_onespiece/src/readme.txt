Testing for the analytical solution (code validation)

1) Fist working version. Validation of the code (u1 and c1).
The next step will be weak Dirichlet boundary conditions for every time step.
10:15    18.03.2010

2) Good code (just save). Before changing strong Dirichlet boundary conditions into weak ones.
10:33	24.03.2010

3) Penalty boundary conditions for u (cells) are realized and work fine.
14:29   30.03.2010

4) Save of strongly Dirichlet conditions. Though weak boundary conditions for $u$ and $c$ are realised. 
They are just commented out.
11:48   31.03.2010

5) Good working code for weak boundary conditions for $u$ and $c$.
14:30   01.04.2010

6) Zero-boundary conditions for $u$. Working code save.
14:27	06.04.2010

7) Zero (weak-penalty) boundary conditions for $u=x(1-x)y(1-y)$ and $c=-x(1-x)y(1-y)$. 
Code is working and delivers good results. FCT (TVD) is under the test.
