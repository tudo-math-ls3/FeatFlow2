!# This module is a demonstration program how to solve a simple Poisson
!# problem with constant coefficients on a simple domain.
!#
!# For simplicity, this example application is derived from
!# poisson2d_method0_simple.
!#
!# The boundary is like in the other applications. Additionally, inside of the
!# domain a fictitious boundary component is placed that introduces
!# Dirichlet-0 values in a couple of cells. For this purpose, an additional
!# callback routine getBoundaryValuesFBC is used that gives an analytical
!# description of the object and returns the values inside of the
!# object to the discretisation framework.

    ! Definitions of variables.
    !
    ! We need a couple of variables for this problem. Let us see...
    !
    ! An object for saving the domain:
    type(t_boundary) :: rboundary
    
    ! An object for saving the triangulation on the domain
    type(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation
    
    ! Path to the mesh
    character(len=SYS_STRLEN) :: spredir

    ! An object specifying the discretisation.
    ! This contains also information about trial/test functions,...
    type(t_blockDiscretisation) :: rdiscretisation
    
    ! A bilinear and linear form describing the analytic problem to solve
    type(t_bilinearForm) :: rform
    type(t_linearForm) :: rlinform
    
    ! A scalar matrix and vector. The vector accepts the RHS of the problem
    ! in scalar form.
    type(t_matrixScalar) :: rmatrix
    type(t_vectorScalar) :: rrhs

    ! A block matrix and a couple of block vectors. These will be filled
    ! with data for the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock) :: rmatrixBlock
    type(t_vectorBlock) :: rvectorBlock,rrhsBlock,rtempBlock

    ! A set of variables describing the analytic and discrete boundary
    ! conditions.
    type(t_boundaryRegion) :: rboundaryRegion
    type(t_discreteBC), target :: rdiscreteBC
    
    ! A structure for discrete fictitious boundary conditions
    type(t_discreteFBC), target :: rdiscreteFBC
    integer, dimension(1) :: Iequations
    
    ! A solver node that accepts parameters for the linear solver
    type(t_linsolNode), pointer :: p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner

    ! An array for the system matrix(matrices) during the initialisation of
    ! the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock), dimension(1) :: Rmatrices

    ! A filter chain that describes how to filter the matrix/vector
    ! before/during the solution process. The filters usually implement
    ! boundary conditions.
    type(t_filterChain), dimension(2), target :: RfilterChain
    
    ! NLMAX receives the level where we want to solve.
    integer :: NLMAX
    
    ! Error indicator during initialisation of the solver
    integer :: ierror
    
    ! We need some more variables for pre/postprocessing.
    real(DP), dimension(:), pointer :: p_Ddata
    
    ! Output block for UCD output to GMV file
    type(t_ucdExport) :: rexport
    character(len=SYS_STRLEN) :: sucddir

    ! Ok, let us start.
    !
    ! We want to solve our Poisson problem on level...
    NLMAX = 7
    
    ! Get the path $PREDIR from the environment, where to read .prm/.tri files
    ! from. If that does not exist, write to the directory "./pre".
    if (.not. sys_getenv_string("PREDIR", spredir)) spredir = './pre'

    ! At first, read in the parametrisation of the boundary and save
    ! it to rboundary.
    call boundary_read_prm(rboundary, trim(spredir)//'/QUAD.prm')
        
    ! Now read in the basic triangulation.
    call tria_readTriFile2D (rtriangulation, trim(spredir)//'/QUAD.tri', rboundary)
    
    ! Refine it.
    call tria_quickRefine2LevelOrdering (NLMAX-1,rtriangulation,rboundary)
    
    ! And create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation.
    call tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation,rboundary)
    
    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies the blocks in the
    ! solution vector. In this simple problem, we only have one block.
    call spdiscr_initBlockDiscr (rdiscretisation,1,&
                                 rtriangulation, rboundary)
    
    ! rdiscretisation%Rdiscretisations is a list of scalar discretisation
    ! structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! Initialise the first element of the list to specify the element
    ! and cubature rule for this solution component:
    call spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1), &
                                   EL_E011,CUB_G2X2,rtriangulation, rboundary)
                                   
    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create a scalar matrix, based on the discretisation structure
    ! for our one and only solution component.
    call bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9,rmatrix)
    
    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 2D.
    
    rform%itermCount = 2
    rform%Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_DERIV_X
    rform%Idescriptors(2,1) = DER_DERIV_X
    rform%Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_DERIV_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV_Y

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .true.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .true.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical
    ! data.
    call bilf_buildMatrixScalar (rform,.true.,rmatrix,coeff_Laplace_2D)
    
    ! The same has to be done for the right hand side of the problem.
    ! At first set up the corresponding linear form (f,Phi_j):
    rlinform%itermCount = 1
    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC
    
    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to get a discrete version of it.
    ! Again we simply create a scalar vector based on the one and only
    ! discretisation structure.
    ! This scalar vector will later be used as the one and only first
    ! component in a block vector.
    call linf_buildVectorScalar (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                 rlinform,.true.,rrhs,coeff_RHS_2D)
    
    ! The linear solver only works for block matrices/vectors - but above,
    ! we created scalar ones. So the next step is to make a 1x1 block
    ! system from the matrices/vectors above which the linear solver
    ! understands.
    call lsysbl_createMatFromScalar (rmatrix,rmatrixBlock,rdiscretisation)
    call lsysbl_createVecFromScalar (rrhs,rrhsBlock,rdiscretisation)
    
    ! Now we have the raw problem. What is missing is the definition of the boundary
    ! conditions.
    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a `filter technique with
    ! discretised boundary conditions`. This means, we first have to calculate
    ! a discrete version of the analytic BC, which we can implement into the
    ! solution/RHS vectors using the corresponding filter.
    !
    ! Create a t_discreteBC structure where we store all discretised boundary
    ! conditions.
    call bcasm_initDiscreteBC(rdiscreteBC)
    !
    ! We 'know' already (from the problem definition) that we have four boundary
    ! segments in the domain. Each of these, we want to use for enforcing
    ! some kind of boundary condition.
    !
    ! We ask the bondary routines to create a 'boundary region' - which is
    ! simply a part of the boundary corresponding to a boundary segment.
    ! A boundary region roughly contains the type, the min/max parameter value
    ! and whether the endpoints are inside the region or not.
    call boundary_createRegion(rboundary,1,1,rboundaryRegion)
    
    ! We use this boundary region and specify that we want to have Dirichlet
    ! boundary there. The following call does the following:
    ! - Create Dirichlet boundary conditions on the region rboundaryRegion.
    !   We specify icomponent='1' to indicate that we set up the
    !   Dirichlet BC`s for the first (here: one and only) component in the
    !   solution vector.
    ! - Discretise the boundary condition so that the BC`s can be applied
    !   to matrices and vectors
    ! - Add the calculated discrete BC`s to rdiscreteBC for later use.

    call lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rtempBlock, .false.)
    
    ! Next step is to implement boundary conditions into the RHS,
