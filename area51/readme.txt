This directory serves as a kind of testing area for applications,
algorithms and whatever has to be tested. Part of the content in this
directory is experimental code and general test applications 
for kernel routines like example programs to test prolongation 
and restriction of a finite element -- so short to say, everything 
which is too elementary to belong to the applications/ directory.
