*) Roe's approximate Riemann solver without dimensional splitting
   gives rise to a small boundary layer in the velocity field
   tangential to the wall even if the low-order method is employed per
   se without flux correction. This does not happen if dimensional
   splitting is used in the low-order method.

*) How to treat source terms within the AFC framework?

*) How to treat periodic boundary conditions in a conservative fashion?
