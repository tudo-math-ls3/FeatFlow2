------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.) Remove the old splib (ILU-k) from the solver module and replace it
    by the routines from the iluk.f90 module.

2.) Prelimiting does not work for FEM-FCT algorithms except for the
    linearised version. We still need to think about how to assemble
    the fluxes for prelimiting.

3.) FEM-FCT algorithms for hydrodynamic model are not working except for the
    linearised version.

4.) Jacobian matrix for the semi-implicit FEM-FCT algorithm has to be
    fixed (it was based on the fluxes but now it has to be based on the
    edgewise correciton factors).

5.) Implement weak boundary conditions in 1D

6.) Implement hydrodynamic model in 3D

7.) Implement Navier-Stokes model

8.) Implement Z-pinch model in x-r coordinates

9.) Implement MHD model

10.) Implement (weak) boundary treatment in 3D

11.) Perform standard test cases from ATHENA website
