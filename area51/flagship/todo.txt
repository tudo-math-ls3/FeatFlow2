------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.) Remove the old splib (ILU-k) from the solver module and replace it
    by the routines from the iluk.f90 module.

2.) Jacobian matrix for the semi-implicit FEM-FCT algorithm has to be
    fixed (it was based on the fluxes but now it has to be based on the
    edgewise correciton factors).

3.) Implement hydrodynamic model in 3D

4.) Implement Navier-Stokes model

5) Implement (weak) boundary treatment in 3D

6.) Perform standard test cases from ATHENA website

7.) Add generic callback routines to overwrite internal routines.

    (x) fcb_calcDivVector
