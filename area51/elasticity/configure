# Default behaviour:
# Do not store object files to home directory, but to some scratch area
# without quota restrictions. Try to come up with a reasonable name
# for the object file directories (per application and one for the libraries
# which are shared among all Featflow2 applications).
#
# Q: Why not store object files directly to the home directory, to the
# same directory where Featflow2 is installed?
# A: At the Faculty of Mathematics, TU Dortmund and the compute servers 
# LiDO, JUMP and NEC file system disk quotas are enforced. But everywhere
# a scratch area providing vast disk space is available - usually without
# backup. But backup is not needed for object files.
#
# Note: this default behaviour can always be overridden by explicitly
# setting --objdir=<some path> on the command line when invoking this
# script!
#
# Specify its directory prefix here.
BASEDIR_OBJFILES=${HOME}/nobackup/feat2obj

# To support multiple working copies of Featflow2 which all store their
# object files beneath ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}, but which should not interfere
# which each other, duplicate the hierarchy of these Featflow2 installations
# beneath ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}. The procedure can be explained most easily
# with an example:
# Consider you have two FF2 installations, one in $HOME/Featflow2 and another
# in $HOME/tmp/Featflow2, then the object files should go to ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}/Featflow2
# and ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}/tmp/Featflow2, respectively.
CWD=`/bin/pwd`

# Try to shorten the directory hierarchy below ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}.
# Why? Because it is used to create the object directory and some
# compilers enforce (silently) restrictions on include and module
# directories (e.g. PGI). Do not let path to object 
# directory become too long!

# Step 1: 
#   try to cut off the leading part ending in your username.
FF2INSTDIR=${CWD}
# $USER is used later on, but not all Unix systems define
# this environment variable, Sun Solaris e.g. does not.
test -z "$USER" && USER="$LOGNAME"
# Username contained in path name?
FF2INSTDIR=`echo ${FF2INSTDIR} | sed "s/^.*\/$USER\//\//;"`;

# Step 2: 
#   remove "Featflow2/"
FF2INSTDIR=`echo ${FF2INSTDIR} | sed "s/\/Featflow2//;"`;

# Concatenate directory strings to come up with a directory name
# for Featflow2 application object files
OBJDIRPREFIX=${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}${FF2INSTDIR}

# Create a likewise directory for all libraries which should
# be shared among all Featflow2 applications as - being a library - 
# they have no dependency on the Featflow2 kernel or a Featflow2 application
# and are all compiled with identical settings.
