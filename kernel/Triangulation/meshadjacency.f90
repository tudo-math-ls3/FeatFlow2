!# <purpose>
!# This module contains routines for the calculation of adjacency graphs
!# for the cells of a mesh. The adjacency graph is similar to the sparsity
!# pattern of a CSR matrix (aka matrix storage technique 7/9), describing
!# which cells are adjacent to each other in respect to a specific adjacency
!# relation. The adjacency graph can be seen as a more extended version of
!# the mesh's IneighboursAtElement array, which is used e.g. for the
!# generation of a coloured partitioning of the mesh's cells.
!#
!# Currently, this module supports up to 3 adjacency types (depending on the
!# mesh's dimension):
!# 1. vertice-based element adjacency (1D/2D/3D):
!#    -> Two elements of the mesh are adjacent if they share at least one
!#       common vertice.
!#
!# 2. edge-based element adjacency (2D/3D):
!#    -> Two elements of the mesh are adjacent if they share at least one
!#       common edge.
!#
!# 3. face-based element adjacency (3D):
!#    -> Two elements of the mesh are adjacent if they share at least one
!#       common face.
!#
!# Additionally, an dimension-dependend alias called "neighbour-based element
!# adjacency" is defined, which is equivalent to "vertice-based" in 1D,
!# "edge-based" in 2D and "face-based" in 3D.
!#
!# The following routines can be found here:
!#
!# 1.) mshadj_calcElementAdjacency
!#     -> Calculates the adjacency graph for a given mesh in repsect to a
!#        specific adjacency relation.
