  !<description>
    ! This subroutine is called during the calculation of errors. It has to compute
    ! the (analytical) values of a function in a couple of points on a couple
    ! of elements. These values are compared to those of a computed FE function
    ! and used to calculate an error.
    !
    ! The routine accepts a set of elements and a set of points on these
    ! elements (cubature points) in in real coordinates.
    ! According to the terms in the linear form, the routine has to compute
    ! simultaneously for all these points.
