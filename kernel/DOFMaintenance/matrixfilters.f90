!# This module contains a set of filters that can be applied to a scalar
!# or block matrix. They can be used e.g. to modify a matrix during a nonlinear
!# solution process to prepare it for a linear solver (like implementing
!# boundary conditions).
!#
!# Typical matrix filters are those working together with discrete
!# boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions e.g. some lines
!# of the global matrix are usually replaced by unit vectors. The corresponding
!# matrix modification routine is a kind of 'filter' for a matrix and
!# can be found in this module.
!#
!# The following routines can be found here:
!#
!#  1.) matfil_discreteBC
!#      -> Apply the 'discrete boundary conditions for matrices' filter
!#         onto a given (block) matrix.
!#         This e.g. replaces lines of a matrix corresponding to Dirichlet DOF's
!#         by unit vectors for all scalar submatrices where configured.
!#
!#  2.) matfil_discreteFBC
!#      -> Apply the 'discrete fictitious boundary conditions for matríces'
!#         filter onto a given (block) matrix.
!#         This e.g. replaces lines of a matrix corresponding to Dirichlet DOF's
!#         by unit vectors for all scalar submatrices where configured.
!#
!#  3.) matfil_discreteNLSlipBC
!#      -> Implement slip boundary conditions into a matrix.
!#         Slip boundary conditions are not implemented by matfil_discreteBC!
!#         They must be implemented separately, as they are a special type
!#         of boundary conditions.
!#
!# Auxiliary routines:
!#
!#  1.) matfil_imposeDirichletBC
!#      -> Imposes Dirichlet BC's into a scalar matrix
!#
!#  2.) matfil_imposeNLSlipBC
!#      -> Imposes nonlinear slip boundary conditions into a scalar matrix
!#
!#  3.) matfil_imposeDirichletFBC
!#      -> Imposes Difichlet BC's for fictitious boundary components
!#         into a scalar matrix

  SUBROUTINE matfil_imposeFeastMirrorBC (rmatrix,boffDiag,rfmbcStructure)
  
!<description>
  ! Implements discrete Feast mirror BC's into a scalar matrix.
  ! The FEAST mirror boundary condition is basically a Neumann boundary
  ! condition which is used for domain decomposition.
  ! One assumes that there is an additional 'virtual' layer of cells added to
  ! a boundary edge. This leads to a slight matrix modification for all
  ! DOF's on that boundary edge. 
  ! Example: For a 5-point stencil with $Q_1$, boundary DOF's get matrix
  ! weights "2, 1, -1/2, -1/2" (center, left, top, bottom), while inner 
  ! points get matrix weights "4, -1, -1, -1, -1" (center and all surroundings).
  ! To make bondary DOF's behave like inner DOF's, the entries in 
  ! the matrices belonging to such an edge have to be doubled,
  ! leading to "4, -1, -1".
  ! So this filter loops through the matrix and doubles all matrix entries
  ! that belong to DOF's on FEAST mirror boundary edges.
