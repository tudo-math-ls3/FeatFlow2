  !<description>
    ! This subroutine is called during the vector assembly. It has to compute
    ! the coefficients in front of the terms of the linear form.
    !
    ! The routine accepts a set of elements and a set of points on these
    ! elements (cubature points) in in real coordinates.
    ! According to the terms in the linear form, the routine has to compute
    ! simultaneously for all these points and all the terms in the linear form
    ! the corresponding coefficients in front of the terms.

  !<input>
    ! The discretisation structure that defines the basic shape of the
    ! triangulation with references to the underlying triangulation,
    ! analytic boundary boundary description etc.

    ! The linear form which is currently to be evaluated:
    type(t_linearForm), intent(IN) :: rform
    
    ! Number of elements, where the coefficients must be computed.
    integer, intent(IN) :: nelements
    
    ! Number of points per element, where the coefficients must be computed
    integer, intent(IN) :: npointsPerElement
    
    ! This is an array of all points on all the elements where coefficients
    ! are needed.
    ! Remark: This usually coincides with rdomainSubset%p_DcubPtsReal.

    ! An array accepting the DOF's on all elements test in the test space.

    integer, dimension(:,:), intent(IN) :: IdofsTest

    ! This is a t_domainIntSubset structure specifying more detailed information
    ! about the element set that is currently being integrated.
    ! It's usually used in more complex situations (e.g. nonlinear matrices).
