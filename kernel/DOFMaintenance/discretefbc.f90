!# This module implements discrete boundary conditions for fictitious boundary
!# components. Discrete boundary conditions for fictitious boundary components
!# are an element-dependent way to represent analytical 'boundary conditions' 
!# in a general sense. After 'discretising', the boundary condition can quickly
!# be implemented into a vector. Therefore, one can see discrete boundary
!# conditions also as a kind of 'precalculated boundary conditions of 
!# fictitious boundary objects'. This is exploited e.g. in the filter approach,
!# where a filter routine 'applies' a discrete FBC to a vector. 
!#
!# Usually, one fictitious boundary object may consist of multiple subobjects
!# like balls or general shapes) which all share the same boundary condition.
!# 'Discretising' this means collecting all the DOF's that are affected by
!# such an object as well as specifying a strategy how to modify matrix,
!# solution and/or RHS vector.
!# 
!# The basic implementation realises the implementation of objects that
!# specify a Dirichlet value in a subdomain of the global domain (e.g. a
!# ball with a specified velocity in a fluid). But this is not
!# the only application: One can even think of a subdomain that exhibits
!# stress to the right hand side of the system.

  ! that must be imposed in this DOF.

    !

    integer(I32), dimension(:), pointer :: p_Iwhere => null()
  
    ! A pointer to an array that accepts calculated values. The callback routine
    ! for evaluating on the fictitious boundary component must fill this

    !
    ! Remark: Depending on what is to be evaluated, not all values (point values,...)
    ! must be calculated. If some values are left out, the callback routine can
    ! use the p_Binside array to indicate what is calculated and what not.

    !   p_Dvalues(i,1) is calculated.
