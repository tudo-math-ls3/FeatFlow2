  !<description>
    ! This subroutine is called during the matrix assembly. It has to compute
    ! the coefficients in front of the terms of the bilinear form.
    !
    ! The routine accepts a set of elements and a set of points on these
    ! elements (cubature points) in real coordinates.
    ! According to the terms in the bilinear form, the routine has to compute
    ! simultaneously for all these points and all the terms in the bilinear form
    ! the corresponding coefficients in front of the terms.

  !<input>
    ! The discretisation structure that defines the basic shape of the
    ! triangulation with references to the underlying triangulation,
    ! analytic boundary boundary description etc.; trial space.

    ! The discretisation structure that defines the basic shape of the
    ! triangulation with references to the underlying triangulation,
    ! analytic boundary boundary description etc.; test space.
    type(t_spatialDiscretisation), intent(in) :: rdiscretisationTest

    ! The bilinear form which is currently being evaluated:
    type(t_bilinearForm), intent(in) :: rform

    ! Number of elements, where the coefficients must be computed.
    integer, intent(in) :: nelements

    ! Number of points per element, where the coefficients must be computed
    integer, intent(in) :: npointsPerElement

    ! This is an array of all points on all the elements where coefficients
    ! are needed.
    ! Remark: This usually coincides with rdomainSubset%p_DcubPtsReal.

    ! This is the number of the boundary component that contains the
    ! points in Dpoint. All points are on the same boundary component.
    integer, intent(in) :: ibct

    ! For every point under consideration, this specifies the parameter
    ! value of the point on the boundary component. The parameter value
    ! is calculated in LENGTH PARAMETRISATION!

    ! An array accepting the DOF`s on all elements in the test space.
    ! DIMENSION(\#local DOF`s in test space,Number of elements)
    integer, dimension(:,:), intent(in) :: IdofsTest

    ! This is a t_domainIntSubset structure specifying more detailed information
    ! about the element set that is currently being integrated.
    ! It is usually used in more complex situations (e.g. nonlinear matrices).
