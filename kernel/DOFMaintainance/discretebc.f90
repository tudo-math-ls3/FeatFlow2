!# <purpose>
!# This module implements discrete boundary conditions. Discrete boundary
!# conditions are an element-dependent way to represent analytical boundary
!# conditions. After "discretising", the boundary condition can quickly
!# be implemented into a vector. Therefore, one can see discrete boundary
!# conditions also as a kind of 'precalculated' boundary conditions. This is 
!# exploited e.g. in the filter approach, where a filter routine 'applies' a 
!# discrete BC to a vector. 
!#
!# The following types of discrete boundary conditions are available:
!#
!# - Dirichlet boundary conditions are typically represented as a
!#   list of DOF's where a value must be prescribed, plus the value that
!#   must be described in that special DOF.
!#
!# - Pressure drop conditions consist of a list of DOF's and a modifier
!#   how to modify the actual DOF's.
!#
!# - Slip boundary conditions consists like Dirichlet boundary conditions
!#   of a list of DOF's, wher zero must be implemented into the defect
!#   vector. Slip boundary conditions are nonlinear boundary conditions:
!#   In case of a linear system, the corresponding DOF's are treated
!#   as Dirichlet. The actual BC is implemented during a nonlinear
!#   loop by modifying the appearing defect vector.
