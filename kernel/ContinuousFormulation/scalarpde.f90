  ! A structure for a scalar bilinear form.

  ! This bilinear form consists of two additive terms. Both terms have

  ! 2.) ballCoeffConstant = true           -> all coefficients constant

  ! A structure for a scalar trilinear form.
  !
  ! Example: For w:R2->R let us take a look at the 2D equation
  !
  !    <tex>$   \int_{\Omega}  w ( \nabla u , \nabla v )  dx $</tex>
  !    <tex>$ = \int_{\Omega}  ( F(w) \nabla u , \nabla v )  dx $</tex>
  !    <tex>$ = \int_{\Omega}  f_1(w)*1*u_x*v_x  +  f_2(w)*1*u_y*v_y  dx $</tex>
  !    <tex>$ = \int_{\Omega}  w*1*u_x*v_x  +  w*1*u_y*v_y  dx $</tex>
  !
  ! with <tex>$F=matrix([f_1,0],[0,f_2])$</tex> specifying derivative quantifiers
  ! to be applied to w, here e.g. <tex>$f_1(w) = f_2(w) = w$</tex>.
  !
  ! This trilinear form consists of two additive terms. Both terms have
  ! a constant coefficient '1' in front of them and consist of a combination
  ! of derivatives in different directions. Additionally to that, there is
  ! a finite element function f(.) given that specifies variable coefficients.
  ! The form itself is encoded with the structure t_trilinearForm as follows:
  !
  !  1.) itermCount = 2                     -> 2 additive terms
  !  2.) ballCoeffConstant = true           -> all coefficients constant
  !  3.) Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0            -> 1st coefficient
  !  5.) Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_FUNC       -> w(x,y) in the 1st term
  !  6.) Idescriptors(2,1) = DER_DERIV_X    -> u_x in the 1st term
  !  7.) Idescriptors(3,1) = DER_DERIV_X    -> v_x in the 1st term
  !  8.) Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0            -> 2nd coefficient
  !  9.) Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_FUNC       -> w(x,y) in the 2nd term
  ! 10.) Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV_Y    -> u_y in the 2nd term
  ! 11.) Idescriptors(3,2) = DER_DERIV_Y    -> v_y in the 2nd term
  !
  ! One diffence to the usual meaning of the descriptors: A value of
  !   Idescriptors(1,i) = 0
  ! instead of DER_xxxx means that the function f is the constant
  ! mapping f_i(u):=1. So this disables the contribution of u for that term.
