!# <purpose>
!# This module maintains a hierarchy of FE spaces.
!#
!# A FE space is realised as a combination of triangulation and
!# discretisation. The problem is that an application may create a
!# discretisation/triangulation and might want to set up a FE space
!# without allocating new memory. The routines in this module provide the
!# functionality to automatically create and refine meshes and discretisation
!# structures when needed and recycling existing information as much as
!# possible:
!#  - If a FE space is created by a trangulation, the triangulation is reused
!#    and only refined if necessary. A new discretisation is created.
!#  - If a FE space is created by an existing discretisation, the
!#    discretisation is reused and only refined if necessary.
!#  - If a FE space is created based on a set of existing discretisations/
!#    triangulations, the routines try to reuse the existing structures and
!#    only refine the mesh/create a new discretisation if they don't find
!#    a proper existing one.
!#
!# All creation routines accept a callback routine fgetdiscr which is called
!# in case a new discretisation must be created based on a mesh. The caller
!# has to provide the functionality to create the discretisation as it is
!# needed.
