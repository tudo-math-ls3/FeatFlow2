# Function to unpack a tarball - as a serialised operation
# using a locking mechanism
#
# Logic:
# If a lock file exists, there is already a concurrent process unpacking the
# tarball. In this case, we merely need to inform the user why this process
# won't extract the tarball - to catch case where the lock file wrongfully
# lingers. But by design it is not necessary to afterwards start extracting
# the tarball, too.
# If no lock file exists, extract the tarball and patch the sources, if
# necessary.
