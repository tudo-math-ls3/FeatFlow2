# short description:
#   script to be able to use the GNU C preprocessor even for Fortran90 source files
#   on every platform we are developing FEAT2 on.
#   The original source file is piped through the GNU C preprocessor,
#   the resulting temporary file is stored to the directory of the first
#   object file or program name found on the command line, the compile
#   statement is accordingly adjusted and finally invoked.
#   Special care is taken to ensure that line numbers of the preprocessed
#   code match those of the original source code.

# Now, it gets complex. Here, we hide all the magic that enables us
# to use the C preprocessor from within Fortran source code.
#
# 1) First, call sed to do some on-the-fly conversions within the source
#    code as needed. See the comments above when seting up the sed commands.
# 2) Then, call the C preprocessor. That's the main intention of this
#    script.
# 3) map 'MYNEWLINE' to '&\n':
#    Necessary because it is not possible to instruct the C preprocessor to
#    set explicit carriage returns at distinct places. In C, that's not
#    necessary as lines may become arbitrarily long. But Fortran 90 accepts
#    only 132 columns and some compilers really respect and enforce this
#    restriction! So, for very long lines, as generated by preprocesor
#    constructs defined in feastdefs.h, the positions where they should be
#    wrapped around are marked with the (arbitrarily chosen) string MYNEWLINE.
#    The output of the C preprocessor is postprocessed and any occurrence of
#    MYNEWLINE is replaced by the Fortran 90 line concatenation operator '&'
#    followed by a carriage return.
#    This has to be done in a separate perl command as the sed command
#    on SUN and NEC do not support matching of carriage returns (\n). Hence,
#    we cannot integrate this substitution with the remaining.
#    (The reason why it is done with perl instead of aggregating it with
#    the subsequently called sed script is the inability of some sed
#    installations to insert a newline character. See question 4.1 of
#    'The SED FAQ'.)
#    Note: On Windows, where f90cpp is not available and the Intel compiler
#    warns, but (currently) accepts overlong source lines, MYNEWLINE gets
#    simply mapped to an empty string ensuring portability of the source code.
# 4a)map '/=%/~' to '//' and '/=%*~' to '/*'
#    (Reverse operation for sed command (3).)
#    The Fortran 90 string concatenation operator '//' indicates in C++
#    the start of a comment. So, macros cannot simply use '//'. Instead
#    we arbitrarily chose the string '/=%/' and after the C preprocessor
#    call we replace it with the correct Fortran 90 string concatenator.
#    The same holds for '/*' which may occur in ascii graphics.
# 4b)map '= >' to '=>', '. TRUE .' to '.TRUE.', '. FALSE .' to '.FALSE.'
#    NEC C preprocessor inserts blanks into the Fortran 90 pointer
#    assignment operator and the boolean constants. These have to be
#    removed again. Any Fortran 90 compiler would bail out.
# 5) The awk constructs ensure that the line numbers of the C preprocessed
#    source code match the line numbers of the original code. So, if
#    we debug the code or the runtime environments reports an error in
#    line X, this awk code ensures that the error really occurred in line
#    X of the code we are editing. Awk adds extra source lines by means
#    of the lines beginning with '#' the C preprocessor adds.
# 6) map '#' at beginning of a line to '!#':
#    Hide the preprocessor directives for the C/C++ compiler (see previous
#    point) from the Fortran compiler.
