This folder contains the reference results of the tests.

To update reference results, copy the content of the corresponding
folder of the tested architecture to update from the benchmark/results 
directory to the benchmark/refsol directory after the test is finished.

The update of reference results can be done with the script "getresults".
Execution of this script copies the results of all tests into the reference
directory, overwriting old reference results.
