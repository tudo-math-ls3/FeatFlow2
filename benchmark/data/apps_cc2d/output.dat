# TODO_MICHAEL_KOESTER: smsgLog needs a unique name in the benchmark.
#                       Even naming the logfile according to '%y%m%d_%H%M', e.g.
#                       ./log/cc2d_20090412_1241.log
#                       is not safe enough when executing several instances
#                       of the program simulateneously, i.e. in a queueing
#                       environment like LiDO. Every instance needs a
#                       dedicated separate output location. 
#
#			It's probably best to define the log file in
#                       this dat file and use an environment variable for the
#                       path component like $LOGDIR to keep it variable.
#                       The new parlst_expandEnvVariables() deals with it then.
