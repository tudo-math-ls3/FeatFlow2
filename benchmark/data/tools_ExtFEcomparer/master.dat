# modus
# =0: don't do the benchmark calculations
# =1: do the benchmark calculations, do not do ucd-output
# =2: do the benchmark calculations, do ucd-output.
# setting it to 0 would be pointless and setting it to 2 is
# just done when developing/adding new features so that you quickly
# can set up a test problem with a graphical reference.
