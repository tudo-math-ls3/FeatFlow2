# calling the FEAT2 configure script, but sets some standard flags
# that are tedious to add always manually.
#
# For a list of valid command line options to FEAT2's configure script, 
# invoke this script with '--help'.

# We want to develop our code in the home directory (because that
# is not only stored on a RAID system, but also backuped regularly
# and we might accidentally delete some files which we can not 
# recover in the nobackup area), but the home directory has disk
# quota restrictions. Given that object files can be easily
# recovered we store them to some scratch area without quota restrictions
# ($HOME/nobackup) and save this way precious quota in the home directory.
#
# Try to come up with a reasonable location in $HOME/nobackup based on
# the current working directory. One could simply append the current
# working directory to a fixed object directory prefix, example:
#  Source directory: $HOME/experimental/Featflow2/area51/cc2dmedium
#  => Obj directory: $HOME/nobackup/feat2obj/$HOME/experimental/Featflow2/area51/cc2dmedium
#
# But in this case the path given to compilers to locate module files
# (-fmod, -J options) and the path to the object file (-o option) can 
# get rather lengthy and some compilers don't accept paths longer 132 
# characters (e.g. PGI). So, try to come up with something more useful:
# cut away the strings "$HOME" and "Featflow2" from the path to the
# current directory and use that:
#  Source directory: $HOME/experimental/Featflow2/area51/cc2dmedium
#  => Obj directory: $HOME/nobackup/feat2obj/experimental/area51/cc2dmedium

# Change to the directory where this script resides
# (it is possible to call this script via <some path>/configure,
# so change to <some path> first.)
SCRIPTPATH=`dirname $0`
cd ${SCRIPTPATH}

# Specify object directory prefix. Try to use a path without quota restrictions.
# If that one does not exist, put the object files to the main package
# directory.
NOQUOTADIR=${HOME}/nobackup

  then
    BASEDIR_OBJFILES=${NOQUOTADIR}/feat2obj

# To support multiple working copies of FEAT2 which all store their
# object files beneath ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}, but which should not interfere
# which each other, duplicate the hierarchy of these FEAT2 installations
# beneath ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}. The procedure can be explained most easily
# with an example:
# Consider you have two FEAT2 installations, one in $HOME/Featflow and another
# in $HOME/tmp/Featflow2, then the object files should go to ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}
# and ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}/tmp, respectively.
CWD=`/bin/pwd`

# Try to shorten the directory hierarchy below ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}.
# Why? Because it is used to create the object directory and some
# compilers enforce (silently) restrictions on include and module
# directories (e.g. PGI). Do not let path to object 
# directory become too long!

# Step 1: 
#   try to cut off the leading part ending in your username.
FEAT2INSTDIR=${CWD}
# $USER is used later on, but not all Unix systems define
# this environment variable, Sun Solaris e.g. does not.
test -z "$USER" && USER="$LOGNAME"
# Username contained in path name?
FEAT2INSTDIR=`echo ${FEAT2INSTDIR} | sed "s|^.*/$USER/|/|;"`;

# Step 2: 
#   remove "featflow2/"
FEAT2INSTDIR=`echo ${FEAT2INSTDIR} | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sed "s|/featflow2/|/|;"`;

# Concatenate directory strings to come up with a directory name
# for FEAT2 application object files
OBJDIRPREFIX=${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}${FEAT2INSTDIR}

# Create a likewise directory for all libraries which should
# be shared among all FEAT2 applications as - being a library - 
# they have no dependency on the FEAT2 kernel or a FEAT2 application
# and are all compiled with identical settings.
OBJDIRLIBPREFIX=`dirname \`dirname ${OBJDIRPREFIX}\``

# Append a directory level if an environment variable named
# FEAT2COMPILERVERSION is set.
# Motivation: When testing several compiler versions, the build ID is
# identical for all runs. As a result, the object directory for libraries is
# shared among these compiler versions. This can lead to linker errors when
# the object files get created by a compiler version that employs symbols not
# present in other versions. So, when compiling the libraries with a more
# recent compiler version and trying to link later using an older compiler
# release, this may fail. Also, when compiling with an older compiler version
# first and later with a newer, potential performance gains of the new
# compiler are squandered by still re-using the object files created by the
# older compiler version.
