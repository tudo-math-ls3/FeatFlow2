# TODO MATTHIAS_MOELLER: tests solving some variant of Euler equation
#
# Description of the file format:
# This file is supposed to be a simple ASCII text file. Settings are
# defined per line via
#   keyword  = value
# The scope of a keyword/value setting is from its definition till
# being overwritten or till the end of file.
# A test definition starts with
#   testid       = ARBITRARY_TESTNAME
# All keyword/value settings defined earlier - as well as those defined in
# the file defaults.fbdef - are automatically assigned to this test definition.
# The value of any keyword can, of course, be subsequently overwritten
# via a line "keyword = value". This updated keyword/value setting will then
# be the default for any subsequently defined test.
# Anything behind a hash sign (#) is regarded as comment.
#
# Every keyword found is exported as environment variable (in uppercase).
# The case of the corresponding values is left untouched.
#
# Example for keyword/value settings inheritance: The following block
#
#	grid = grids/foo/bar1.feast
#	mglevels = 1,2,3,4
#
#	testid   = FOO1
#	appl = baz
#
#	testid   = FOO2
#	grid = grids/foo/bar2.feast
#
#	testid   = FOO3
#	appl = foobar
#	mglevels = 5,6
#
# is equivalent to
#
#	testid   = FOO1
#	appl = baz
#	grid = grids/foo/bar1.feast
#	mglevels = 1,2,3,4
#
#	testid   = FOO2
#	appl = baz
#	grid = grids/foo/bar2.feast
#	mglevels = 1,2,3,4
#
#	testid   = FOO3
#	appl = foobar
#	grid = grids/foo/bar2.feast
#	mglevels = 5,6
