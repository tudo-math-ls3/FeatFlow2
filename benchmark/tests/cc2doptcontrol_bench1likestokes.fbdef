# This test tests the solver behaviour on the bench1 mesh.
# The target flow is a nonstationary Stokes flow at Re=20.
# The calculation is done with the Navier-Stokes equation.
# Aim: The Navier-Stokes flow should behave like a Stokes flow.
# As a result, the calculated control emulates the negative
# nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes flow to compensate for that.
