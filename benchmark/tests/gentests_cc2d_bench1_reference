# Script to generate the reference tests for the bench1 test.
#
# The script generates a FBDEF file and a couple of FBCONF files with all test 
# IDs. The tests are created in such a way, that every test calculates
# a small amount of the time scale and saves the final solution. A consecutive
# test can then continue based on the previously calculated solution.
# Therefore, all tests in one FBCONF file have to be consecutively executed!
# Afterwards, the drag/lift values have to be concatenated (except the first
# two lines which contain old data).
#
# Execute this script in the benchmark directory!
