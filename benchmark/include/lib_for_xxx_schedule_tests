Usage: $0 [-h] [-p jobfile prefix] [-m email address] [-w wallclock limit] [-a jobid] <TEST ID | test suite> [<TEST ID | test suite>]

$0 provides a convenient way to schedule one 
or more FEAST benchmark tests (identified by test ID, given directly 
or in a *.fbconf file) on $system. The script creates a 
job file for every test ID, takes care of including instructions to 
load the very same modules at run time as are currently loaded and 
submits the job file to the scheduler.

  --afterjob <jobid>, -a <jobid>
      Optional parameter. If specified, the new job(s) is/are executed
      after the job <jobid> is finished. This allows sequential execution
      of jobs that are manually added to the queue system.
  --email <email address>, -m <email address>
      Optional parameter that allows to specify an email address where
      a notification email is sent after completition of the job.
      Default: $EMAILADDRESS
  --help, -h
      prints this usage statement
  --overwrite-log-directory, -o
      In case a benchmark test ID's log directory does already exist, don't
      rename it to save its content, but re-use it. Potentially overwrites
      previously calculated data.
  --prefix <jobfile prefix>, -p <jobfile prefix>
      Optional prefix for job files. In particular used by nightly
      regression test to identify jobs compiled with different compilers.
      Based on this prefix, it can be automatically detected from 'qsub'
      output when all benchmark jobs (using the same compiler) are finished.
      Default: $JOBFILEPREFIX
  --wallclocklimit <wallclock time>, -w <wallclock time>
      Optional parameter that allows to specify the maximum allowed
      wallclock time the job may use; the cluster environment usually
      kills the job if it takes longer. The format is "hours:min:sec",
      e.g. "00:40:00".
      Default: $WALLCLOCKLIMIT
  --corespernode <cores>, -c <cores>
      Allows to define how many cores should be allocated on the cluster
      per processor. If not being set, the standard behaviour is to allocate
      all cores of a processor to prevent a processor from being shared
      by multiple tasks. This is necessary e.g. for correct timings.
      Manually specifying e.g. a 1 here allows to share one processor for
      multiple tasks if e.g. the execution time is not important.
      Default: $CORESPERNODE
  --noschedule
      Creates a job script but does not schedule the job. Used for
      debugging purposes.
  TEST ID
      a valid identifier for a FEAST benchmark test, defined in one of
      the *.fbdef files stored in directory benchmark/tests.
  test suite
      a *.fbconf file containing valid identifiers for FEAST benchmark tests


Example:
  # Perform quicktests
  $0 quicktests.fbconf

  # Perform singletests and additionally test SCARC005
  $0 singletests.fbconf SCARC005

  # Perform singletests and additionally test SCARC005, jobfiles are named "fb-intel.*"
  $0 -p fb-intel singletests.fbconf SCARC005
