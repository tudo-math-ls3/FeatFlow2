A Perl script used by 
* fbenchmark2/bin/runregressiontest
to collect the results of a FEAST benchmark executed via a 
queueing system. It creates a logfile containing the non-redundant
data of all files matching <basename>.* and adds statistics at the
end about successful, deviant and crashed tests.

The current implementation implicitly assumes that every logfile
only contains the output of a single test ID run: If more than one
test ID output is contained, every test that has hit the wallclock time
limit (and hence has an incomplete log output) and that is not the
last one in a logfile is not detected as crashed test!

Available options:
--help              Print this message
--version           Show version information
};
