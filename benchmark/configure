# This shell script is used to prepare the FEAT2 regression benchmark
# for compilation. It is simply a wrapper for calling the FEAT2
# configure script which in turn creates a Makefile for the benchmark
# as well as Makefiles for every benchmark application (i.e. all
# directories whose name starts with either "apps_", "userapps_"
# "tools_", "tutorials_" or "area51_".)
#
# For a list of valid command line options to FEAT2's configure script, 
# invoke this script with '--help'.

# Don't let the script be confused by non-english messages
# from system information programs.
# (LC_ALL overrides the value of the LANG environment variable 
# and the values of any other LC_* environment variables.)
LC_ALL=C

# Change to the directory where this script resides
# (it is possible to call this script via <some path>/configure,
# so change to <some path> first.)
SCRIPTPATH=`dirname $0`

# Finally, invoke the real work horse, FEAT2's configure, and instruct it
# to prepare the FEAT2 regression benchmark for compilation, i.e. to
# create benchmark/Makefile and {apps_*,userapps_*,tools_*,tutorials_*,area51_*}/Makefile.
#
# Any command line parameters given when invoking this script are
# passed to the 'real' configure script as well (via "$@"). They can
# be used to override any hard coded setting.
