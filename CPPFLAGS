List of preprocessor flags:
---------------------------

1) Flags to indicate special compilation features

DEBUG, _DEBUG : Defined if compiled in debug mode


3) Flags to enable special features which are disabled by default

ENABLE_COPROCESSOR_SUPPORT : enable support for coprocessor devices (e.g. CUDA)
ENABLE_ERROR_TRACEBACK     : enable traceback of errors
ENABLE_QUADPREC            : enable quad precision routines
FEAT2_NURBS                : enable support for NURBS (requires additional library)


4) Flags to indicate that architecture/OS has special features

HAS_HIGH_RES_CLOCK            : high-resolution clock is available
HAS_INTRINSIC_FLUSH           : Fortran compiler has FLUSH function
HAS_INTRINSIC_IARGC           : Fortran compiler has intrinsic IARGC function
HAS_INTRINSIC_IEEE_ARITHMETIC : Fortran compiler has intrinsic IEEE_ARITHMETIC module
HAS_INTRINSIC_ISATTY          : Fortran compiler has intrinsic ISATTY function
HAS_INTRINSIC_ISNAN           : Fortran compiler has intrinsic ISNAN function
HAS_ISO_C_BINDING             : Fortran compiler supports iso_c_bindings


5) Flags to tell that some special featires should be used

USE_COMPILER_XXX  : indicates compiler used to compile the code
USE_C_PTR_STORAGE : storage manager uses C_PTR mechanism instead of standard
                    ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE which allows for higher memory throughput
                    if ENABLE_COPROCESSOR_SUPPORT is turned on
USE_LARGEINT      : use 64-bit Integers by default
USE_OPENMP        : use Open-MP parallelisation
USE_INTEL_MKL     : use sparse BLAS routines from Intel MKL library


5) Flags to active warning messages which are turned off be default

WARN_DEPREC       : print warning message if depreceaded code is used
