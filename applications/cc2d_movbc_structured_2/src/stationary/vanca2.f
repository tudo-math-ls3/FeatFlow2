C     Block Gauss-Seidel on Schur Complement
C=======================================================================

C     Basic algorithm:
C
C     What are we doing here? Well, we want to perform *smoothing*.
C     This is an iteration to the solution vector in the form of a
C     defect correction:
C
C       x_n+1  =  x_n + Omega C^-1 (b - A x_n)
C
C     With C=A, this simplifies to the simple update formula:
C
C       x_n+1  =  x_n + Omega (x* - x_n)
C
C     where x* is the solution of the problem. In our case, we replace
C     x* by an approximated "better" solution x calculated from x_n.
C     Furthermore by replacing Omega=1-RLXSM, we obtain the smoothing 
C     formula
C
C       x_n+1  =  RLXSM x_n + (1-RLXSM) x
C
C     Now the big question: How to calculate x from x_n???
C     This is done in a "local Block-Gauss-Seidel" manner. This means,
C     we subsequently update some entries in x_n and use these in
C     later computations to update some other entries. Note that this is
C     not a Gauss-Seidel algorithm in closer sense, but more a
C     Gauss-Seidel type method: We calculate new entries from old ones
C     and from previously calculated new ones!
C
C     This is done in the following way: Imagine our global system:
C
C         [ A   B ] (u) = (f)
C         [ B^t 0 ] (p)   (g)
C
C     In the Navier-Stokes equations with (u,p) being the solution
C     vector, there should be g=0 - but this cannot be assumed
C     as it does not happen in general.
C     Now the algorithm for generating a new (u,p) vector from the old
C     one reads roughly as follows:
C
C     a) Restrict to a small part of the domain, in our case to one cell.
C     b) Fetch all the data (velocity, pressure) on that cell. On the
C        first cell, we have only "old" velocity entries. These values
C        are updated and then the calculation proceeds with the 2nd cell.
C
C               old                      new
C            |---X---|                |---X---|
C            |       |                |       |
C        old X   1   X old   -->  new X   1   X new
C            |       |                |       |
C            |---X---|                |---X---|
C               old                      new
C
C        From the second cell on, there might be "old" data and "new" 
C        data on that cell - the old data that has not been updated and
C        perhaps some already updated velocity data from a neighbor cell.
C        
C               new     old                   new     new
C            |---X---|---X---|             |---X---|---X---|
C            |       |       |             |       |       |
C        new X   1   X   2   X old --> new X   1   X   2   X new
C            |       |new    |             |       |newer  |
C            |---X---|---X---|             |---X---|---X---|
C               new     old                   new     new
C
C        These values are updated and then the calculation proceeds
C        with the next cell.
C        As can be seen in the above picture, the "new" node in the
C        middle is even going to be a "newer" node when handled again
C        for the 2nd cell. This is meant by "Gauss-Seldel" character:
C        Information is updated subsequently by using "old" data and
C        "new" data from a previous calculation.
C
C     So we start with a loop over all elements

      DO IEL=1,NEL
      
C       We now have the element
C                                            U3/V3
C       |---------|                       |----X----|
C       |         |                       |         |
C       |   IEL   |   with DOF's    U4/V4 X    P    X U2/V2
C       |         |                       |         |
C       |---------|                       |----X----|
C                                            U1/V1
C      
C       Fetch the pressure P on the current element into FFP
      
        FFP=FP(IEL)

C       Loop over all 4 U-nodes of that element

        DO II=1,4

C         Set I to the DOF that belongs to our edge II:

          IMID = KMID(II,IEL)
          I    = IMID-NVT
          
C         Write the number of the edge/node to IU:
          
          IU(II) = I
          
C         Write into BDBC whether the edge is a Dirichlet-
C         Boundary edge:
          
          BDBC(II) = IAND(KXNPR(1,IMID),2**12).NE.0

C         Put on AA(.) the diagonal entry of matrix A

          IA1    = KLDA(I)
          AA(II) = A(IA1)

C         Set FF1/FF2 initially to the value F1/F2 of the right hand
C         side vector that belongs to our current DOF corresponding
C         to II

          FF1(II) = F1(I)
          FF2(II) = F2(I)
          
C         What do we have at this point?
C         FF1/FF2: "local" RHS vector belonging to the DOF's on the
C                  current element
C         AA     : Diagonal entries of A belonging to these DOF's
C         BDBC   : Whether the DOF's belong to Dirichlet nodes
C
C         And at the moment:
C         I      : number of current DOF on element IEL
C         II     : "local" number of DOF on element IEL, i.e.
C                  number of the edge
C
C         Now comes the crucial point with the "update": How to
C         subsequently update the vertex values, such that the whole
C         thing still converges to the solution, even if a node
C         is updated more than once? Here, we use a typical
C         matrix-decomposition approach:
C
C         Again consider the problem:
C         
C            [ A   B ] (u) = (f)
C            [ B^t 0 ] (p)   (g)
C     
C         We assume, that all components in the vector (u,p) are
C         given - except for the four velocity unknowns and the
C         pressure unknown on the current element; these five unknowns
C         are located anywhere in the (u,p) vector. The idea is to
C         shift "everything known" to the right hand side to obtain
C         a system for only these unknowns!
C
C         Extracting all the lines of the system that correspond to
C         DOF's on our single element IEL results in a rectangular
C         system of the form
C
C            [ === A^ === B~ ] (|) = (f)   
C            [ B~^t       0  ] (u)   (g)   
C                              (|)
C                              (p)
C
C         <=>  [ MAT1 MAT2 B~ ] (u) = (fu)
C              [    ****   0  ] (p)   (fp)
C
C         with A^ being an 4 x (2*NVT) matrix for the two velocity
C         components and B being an (2*4) x 1 matrix that couples the
C         velocities to the pressure on our current element.
C         B~ is a 8 x 2 matrix: As every velocity couples with at most
C         two pressure elements on the neighbour cell, so we have
C         2 columns in the B-matrix.
C
C                IEL                              IEL
C             |--------|             |--------|--------|
C             |        |             |        |        |
C             |   P    |      or     |   Q    X   P    |
C             |        |             |        |        |
C           --|---X----|--           |--------|--------|
C
C         Now, throw all summands to the RHS vector that do
C         not correspond to the velocity/pressure DOF's on our single 
C         element IEL!
C
C         That way, A^ is reduced to a square matrix with two square
C         submatrices A~ of size 4 x 4. The 8 x 2-matrix B~ reduces to 
C         two 4 x 1 submatrices (originally, every velocity couples with
C         two pressure elements on the neighbour cell, so we have
C         2 columns in the B-matrix).
C
C         The system roughly looks like:
C
C         [ ....        B1 ] (u1)   (f1)           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [ .A~.        |  ] (u2)   (| )           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [ ....        |  ] (u3)   (| )           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [ ....        |  ] (u4)   (| )           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [       ....  B2 ] (v1) = (f2) - sum u_i (ci) - sum v_i (di) - sum   Q (qi)
C         [       .A~.  |  ] (v2)   (| )   i>4     (| )   i>4     (| )  Q in N   (| )
C         [       ....  |  ] (v3)   (| )           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [       ....  |  ] (v4)   (| )           (| )           (| )           (| )
C         [ B1^T  B2^T  0  ] (p )   (fp)           (0 )           (0 )           (0 )
C
C         assuming in the example that element IEL contains u1,u2,u3,u4,
C         v1,v2,v3,v4 and p as DOF's, and using the notation that ci 
C         and di are the i th column of matrix MAT1 and MAT2 above,
C         respectively. 
C         Q is the pressure on the neighbour elements in the 
C         neighbourhood N of element IEL and
C         qi the corresponding column from the B~-matrix.
C
C         But we do even more! Consider the 4x4-matrix A~. This can be
C         decomposed into A~ = L+S+R with L being the lower left, R 
C         being the upper right and S being the diagonal part of A~.
C         Again, throw Lu, Ru and Lv, Rv to the right hand side vector,
C         leaving alone the diagonal 4x4 matrix S on the left:
C        
C         [ *           B1 ] (u1)   (d11)
C         [  *          |  ] (u2)   (d12)
C         [   *         |  ] (u3)   (d13)
C         [    *        |  ] (u4)   (d14)       [ S         B1 ] (ul)   (du)
C         [       *     B2 ] (v1) = (d21)  <=>  [      S    B2 ] (vl) = (dv)
C         [        *    |  ] (v2)   (d22)       [ B1^t B2^t  0 ] (p )   (dp)
C         [         *   |  ] (v3)   (d23)
C         [          *  |  ] (v4)   (d24)
C         [ B1^T  B2^T  0  ] (p )   (d33)
C
C         with d1k = f1k - sum  A~(k,i) u_i.
C                          i<>k
C         d2k is calculated similar. (du, dv, dp) is called 
C         "local residuum".
C
C         Note: This only holds for inner edges!                                 
C         Do we have a boundary edge?

          IF (.NOT.BDBC(II)) THEN

C           No, we have an inner edge.
C
C           Create a "local" residuum!
C           Take the original RHS and subtract all entries of "A*u" to
C           this RHS as being given. What we throw here to the RHS is
C           therefore on one hand a set of entries of the old velocities
C           as well as a set of entries which might have been calculated
C           by a previous update of another cell in our neighbourhood.

            IA2=KLDA(I+1)-1
            DO IA=IA1+1,IA2
              J=KCOLA(IA)
              AOFF=A(IA)
              FF1(II) = FF1(II)-AOFF*U1(J)
              FF2(II) = FF2(II)-AOFF*U2(J)
            END DO

C           Get BB1,BB2 and modify FF1,FF2.
C
C           In every line of each B-matrix, there is either one entry
C           (in case of boundary nodes) or there are at most two entries
C           (for inner nodes, which where each velocity component couples
C           with two elements:
C
C                IEL                              IEL
C             |--------|             |--------|--------|
C             |        |             |        |        |
C             |   P1   |      or     |   P2   X   P1   |
C             |        |             |        |        |
C           --|---X----|--           |--------|--------|
C
C           Our current edge is either an inner edge with two elements
C           attached, or a boundary edge with Neumann boundary
C           conditions.
C
C           In the case that two elements meet each other, we subtract
C           the B*pressure of the neighbour cell from the RHS.
C
C           In the case that we have only one element, there's
C           only one entry in the row of the B-matrix. We fetch the
C           first and last entry of the line, which will coincide
C           then (IB1=IB2). As there is no neighbour cell, we must
C           not subtract anything from the RHS! Nevertheless we have to
C           note the column numbers in the B-matrices to our BB1/BB2
C           vectors.
C
C           Get the first and last entry from row I of the B-matrices:

            IB1=KLDB(I)
            IB2=KLDB(I+1)-1
            JP1=KCOLB(IB1)
            JP2=KCOLB(IB2)

C
C           In case our edge is Neumann-boundary type, there's only one

C       of this local system really gives new values for velocity/
C       pressure and not "update" values like in a defect correction
C       approach!

C     We don't use directly (U1,U2,P) (although we could do),

C     amount of smoothing. RLXSM=1.0 means: Take the full newly
C     calculated vector as solution.

C     This routine uses a "Block-Gauss-Seidel" strategy to update the
C     solution vector (U1,U2,UP) locally to a new iterate.
C     "Block-Gauss-Seidel" means here, that the new solution vector
C     is calculated by parts of the old one and by parts of the new
C     one, which were calculated by a previous call to this routine.
C
C     What we want to calculate are two things: 1.) a new pressure and
C     2.) a new velocity. Both can be calculated from the 
C     RHS using the Schur-Complement approach.
C
C     Assume we have a system:
C
C      [ S   B ] (u) = (f)
C      [ B^t 0 ] (p)   (g)
C
C     with >>S, B, u, p, f, g given locally on one patch of the mesh.<<
C     Here S is given as a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries of
C     the original system matrix. We can write:
C     
C                u = S^-1 (f-Bp)
C            B^t u = g
C
C     Inserting the first equation into the second one gives:
C
C           B^t S^-1 (f-Bp) = g
C
C      <=>   -B^t S^-1 B p  =  g - B^t S^-1 f
C            ***********       **************
C               =: DP              =: FFP
C
C     Remark that DP is a 1x1-system, i.e. a scalar! Therefore
C     calculating DP^-1 to get p=DP^-1*FFP on the current cell
C     is trivial! So FFP/DP will be the pressure on the element IEL.
C
C     Calculating an update for the velocity 
C
C          u = S^-1 (f-Bp)
C
C     is then also trivial as S (and thus S^-1) is a diagonal matrix.

      DO II=1,4
      
C       DD1/DD2 saves the entries of the B1/B2-matrix - except for
C       if the vertex is a boundary vertex!
      
        IF (BDBC(II))  THEN
          DD1(II)=0D0
          DD2(II)=0D0
        ELSE
          DD1(II)=BB1(II)
          DD2(II)=BB2(II)
        ENDIF
        
        IF (DABS(AA(II)).LT.1.D-10)  THEN

C          WRITE(MTERM,*)'II, I, BNDR(II) : ',II,IU(II),BDBC(II)
          RETURN
        ENDIF
        
C       AI(.) saves the diagonal matrix S^-1:
    
        AI(II)=1D0/AA(II)
        
      END DO

C     Factorization loop
C
C     What we at first want to calculate is p with
C
C             - B^t S^-1 B p  =  g - B^t S^-1 f
C
C     To calculate that for local B, S, f and p, consider at first
C     the dimensions in this system:
C
C     a) B is a 4x1 matrix 
C     b) S^-1 is a diagonal matrix, given by the 4 diagonal entries of A
C     c) B^t S^-1 B is therefore a 1x1 matrix, thus a scalar
C
C     So in the factorization loop we can calculate:
C
C       DP  = - (B^T S^-1 B)
C       FFP = g - (B^T S^-1 f)
C
C     As S and S^-1 are a diagonal matrices, we can exploit
C     B^T S^-1  =  S^-1 B^T  which saves some multiplications...

      DP=0D0
      
      DO II = 1,4
        DP  = DP  - AI(II)*(BB1(II)*DD1(II)+BB2(II)*DD2(II))
        FFP = FFP - AI(II)*(BB1(II)*FF1(II)+BB2(II)*FF2(II))
      END DO

C     Solution "loop":

      IF (DABS(DP).LT.1.D-10)  THEN
c        WRITE(MTERM,*)'ERROR in ELUPD2: DP is nearly zero'
        RETURN
      ENDIF
      
C     At first we calculate the pressure on element IEL,
C     which is simply given by multiplying FFP with the
C     inverte "matrix" DP, i.e.:
      
      PP = FFP/DP
      
C     With the help of the pressure, calculate the velocity.
C     This can be done again by the Schur-Complement approach using
C
C           u = S^-1 (f-Bp)
C
C     locally on the current cell:
      
      DO II=1,4
        UU1(II) = AI(II)*(FF1(II)-DD1(II)*PP)
        UU2(II) = AI(II)*(FF2(II)-DD2(II)*PP)
      END DO

C     Update the global solution vector (U1,U2,P).
C     Overwrite the pressure on element IEL and the
C     velocity in the four DOF's on element IEL by the
C     new pressure/velocity values in these nodes:

      P(IEL)=PP
      
      DO II = 1,4

C       Don't overwrite velocities on Dirichlet-boundary vertices!

        IF (.NOT.BDBC(II)) THEN
          I=IU(II)
          U1(I)=UU1(II)
          U2(I)=UU2(II)
        END IF
        
      END DO
