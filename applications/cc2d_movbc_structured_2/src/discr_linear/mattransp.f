* Transpose matrix structure
*
* This routine accepts the structure of a structure-7 or structure-9
* matrix and creates the structure of the transposed matrix from it.
*
* The resulting structure is not pivoted anymore with the diagonal
* entry in front if a structure-7 matrix is to be transposed!
*
* In:
*   NROW   : Number of rows in the matrix
*   NCOL   : Number of columns in the matrix
*   KCOL   : array [1..NA] of integer
*            Column structure of the matrix
*   KLD    : array [1..NROW+1] of integer
*            Row structure of the matrix
*   KTMP   : array [1..NCOL] of integer
*            Auxiliary array
*
* Out:
*   KCOLD  : array [1..NA] of integer
*            Will be filled with the column structure of the transposed
*            matrix. The array must have the same size as KCOL.
*   KLDD   : array [1..NCOL+1] of integer
*            Will be filled with the row structure of the transposed
*            matrix. The array must have the same size as KCOL.

      SUBROUTINE TRST79 (NROW,NCOL,KCOL,KLD,KTMP,KCOLD,KLDD)
      
      IMPLICIT NONE
      
C     parameter
      
      INTEGER NCOL,NROW
      INTEGER KCOL(*),KLD(*),KCOLD(*),KLDD(*),KTMP(*)
      
C     local variables

      INTEGER NA,I,J,KP
      
C     size of the matrix?      

      NA = KLD(NROW+1) - 1
      
C     At first determine the number of elements in each column.
C     For this purpose, build the KLDD array.
C
C     Count how many entries <> 0 are in each column. Note this
C     into the KLDD array.
C     This requires one loop through the matrix structure. The
C     corresponding number is written into KLDD, shifted by 1
C     (i.e. KLDD(2) is the number of entries of the 1st column).
C     This helps to create the real KLDD more easily later.

      CALL LCL3 (KLDD,NCOL+1)
      DO I = 1,NA
        KLDD(KCOL(I)+1) = KLDD(KCOL(I)+1) + 1
      END DO
      
C     Now build the real KLDD. this consists of indices, where 
C     each row starts. Row 1 starts at position 1:

      KLDD (1) = 1
      
C     Adding the number of entries KLLD(i) in the row to
C     KLLD(i-1) gives the new row pointer of row i of the transposed
C     matrix.

      DO I = 2,NCOL+1
        KLDD(I) = KLDD(I) + KLDD(I-1)
      END DO

C     That's it for KLDD. Now, KCOLD must be created.
C     This requires another loop through the matrix structure.
C     KTMP receives the index how many entries have been written
C     to each column.

      CALL LCL3 (KTMP,NCOL)
      
      DO I = 1,NROW
      
        DO J = 1,KLD (I+1)-KLD(I)
        
C         Get the column of the item in question:
        
          KP = KCOL(KLD(I)+J-1)          
          
C         Note the right column number in KCOLD:
          
          KCOLD (KLDD(KP)+KTMP(KP)) = I    
          
C         Increment running index of that row

          KTMP (KP) = KTMP (KP) + 1      
          
        END DO
        
      END DO
      
C     KCOLD also finished, that's it.
