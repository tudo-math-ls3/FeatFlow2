    TYPE(t_discreteBC), POINTER ::p_rdiscreteBC_Q1

    ! Ok, let's start.
    !
    ! We want to solve our Laplace problem on level...
    NLMAX = 7

    ! At first, read in the parametrisation of the boundary and save
    ! it to rboundary.
    ! Set p_rboundary to NULL to create a new structure on the heap.
    NULLIFY(p_rboundary)
    CALL boundary_read_prm(p_rboundary, './pre/QUAD.prm')

    ! Now read in the basic triangulation.
    CALL tria_readTriFile2D (rtriangulation, './pre/QUAD.tri', p_rboundary)
    
    ! Refine it.
    CALL tria_quickRefine2LevelOrdering (NLMAX-1,rtriangulation,p_rboundary)
    
    ! And create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation.
    CALL tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation,p_rboundary)
    
    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies the blocks in the
    ! solution vector. In this simple problem, we only have one block.
    CALL spdiscr_initBlockDiscr2D (rdiscretisation,1,&
                                   rtriangulation, p_rboundary)

    ! rdiscretisation%Rdiscretisations is a list of scalar discretisation
    ! structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! Initialise the first element of the list to specify the element
    ! and cubature rule for this solution component:
    CALL spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscretisation(1), &
                                   EL_EM30,CUB_G2X2,rtriangulation, p_rboundary)

    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create a scalar matrix, based on the discretisation structure
    ! for our one and only solution component.
    CALL bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscretisation(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9,rmatrix)

    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 2D.

    rform%itermCount = 2
    rform%Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_DERIV_X
    rform%Idescriptors(2,1) = DER_DERIV_X
    rform%Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_DERIV_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV_Y

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .TRUE.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .TRUE.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical
    ! data.
    CALL bilf_buildMatrixScalar (rform,.TRUE.,rmatrix,coeff_Laplace)

    ! The same has to be done for the right hand side of the problem.
    ! At first set up the corresponding linear form (f,Phi_j):
    rlinform%itermCount = 1
    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC

    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to get a discrete version of it.
    ! Again we simply create a scalar vector based on the one and only
    ! discretisation structure.
    ! This scalar vector will later be used as the one and only first
    ! component in a block vector.
    CALL linf_buildVectorScalar (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscretisation(1),&
                                 rlinform,.TRUE.,rrhs,coeff_RHS)

    ! The linear solver only works for block matrices/vectors - but above,
    ! we created scalar ones. So the next step is to make a 1x1 block
    ! system from the matrices/vectors above which the linear solver
    ! understands.
    CALL lsysbl_createMatFromScalar (rmatrix,rmatrixBlock,rdiscretisation)
    CALL lsysbl_createVecFromScalar (rrhs,rrhsBlock,rdiscretisation)

    ! Now we have the raw problem. What is missing is the definition of the boudary
    ! conditions.
    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a 'filter technique with
    ! discretised boundary conditions'. This means, we first have to calculate
    ! a discrete version of the analytic BC, which we can implement into the
    ! solution/RHS vectors using the corresponding filter.
    !
    ! At first, we need the analytic description of the boundary conditions.
    ! Initialise a structure for boundary conditions which accepts this:
    !
    ! Set p_rboundaryConditions to create a new structure on the heap.
    NULLIFY (p_rboundaryConditions)
    CALL bcond_initBC (p_rboundaryConditions,p_rboundary)

    ! We 'know' already (from the problem definition) that we have four boundary
    ! segments in the domain. Each of these, we want to use for inforcing
    ! some kind of boundary condition.
    !
    ! We ask the bondary routines to create a 'boundary region' - which is
    ! simply a part of the boundary corresponding to a boundary segment.
    ! A boundary region roughly contains the type, the min/max parameter value
    ! and whether the endpoints are inside the region or not.
    CALL boundary_createRegion(p_rboundary,1,1,rboundaryRegion)

    ! We use this boundary region and specify that we want to have Dirichlet
    ! boundary there. The following routine adds a new 'boundary condition region'
    ! for the first segment to the boundary condition structure.
    ! The region will be set up as 'Dirichlet boundary'.
    ! We specify icomponent='1' to indicate that we set up the
    ! Dirichlet BC's for the first (here: one and only) component in the solution
    ! vector.
    ! The routine also returns the created object in p_rbcRegion so that we can
    ! modify it - but accept it as it is, so we can ignore that.
    CALL bcond_newDirichletBConRealBD (p_rboundaryConditions,1,&
                                       rboundaryRegion,p_rbcRegion)

    ! Now to the edge 2 of boundary component 1 the domain. We use the
    ! same two routines to add the boundary condition to p_rboundaryConditions.
    CALL boundary_createRegion(p_rboundary,1,2,rboundaryRegion)
    CALL bcond_newDirichletBConRealBD (p_rboundaryConditions,1,&
                                       rboundaryRegion,p_rbcRegion)

    ! Edge 3 of boundary component 1.
    CALL boundary_createRegion(p_rboundary,1,3,rboundaryRegion)
    CALL bcond_newDirichletBConRealBD (p_rboundaryConditions,1,&
                                       rboundaryRegion,p_rbcRegion)

    ! Edge 4 of boundary component 1. That's it.
    CALL boundary_createRegion(p_rboundary,1,4,rboundaryRegion)
    CALL bcond_newDirichletBConRealBD (p_rboundaryConditions,1,&
                                       rboundaryRegion,p_rbcRegion)

    ! The boundary conditions are set up, but still the block discretisation
    ! does not know about it. So inform the discretisation which
    ! analytic boundary conditions to use:
    rdiscretisation%p_rboundaryConditions => p_rboundaryConditions

    ! For the discrete problem, we need a discrete version of the above
    ! boundary conditions. So we have to discretise them.
    ! The following routine gives back p_rdiscreteBC, a pointer to a
    ! discrete version of the boundary conditions. Remark that
    ! the pointer has to be nullified before calling the routine,
    ! otherwise, the routine tries to update the boundary conditions
    ! in p_rdiscreteBC!
    NULLIFY(p_rdiscreteBC)
    CALL bcasm_discretiseBC (rdiscretisation,p_rdiscreteBC,.FALSE., &
                             getBoundaryValues)

    ! Hang the pointer into the vector and matrix. That way, these
    ! boundary conditions are always connected to that matrix and that
    ! vector.
    rmatrixBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => p_rdiscreteBC
    rrhsBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => p_rdiscreteBC

    ! Now we have block vectors for the RHS and the matrix. What we
    ! need additionally is a block vector for the solution and
    ! temporary data. Create them using the RHS as template.
    ! Fill the solution vector with 0:
    CALL lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rvectorBlock, .TRUE.)
    CALL lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rtempBlock, .FALSE.)

    ! Next step is to implement boundary conditions into the RHS,
    ! solution and matrix. This is done using a vector/matrix filter
    ! for discrete boundary conditions.
    ! The discrete boundary conditions are already attached to the
    ! vectors/matrix. Call the appropriate vector/matrix filter that
    ! modifies the vectors/matrix according to the boundary conditions.
    CALL vecfil_discreteBCrhs (rrhsBlock)
    CALL vecfil_discreteBCsol (rvectorBlock)
    CALL matfil_discreteBC (rmatrixBlock)

    ! During the linear solver, the boundary conditions are also
    ! frequently imposed to the vectors. But as the linear solver
    ! does not work with the actual solution vectors but with
    ! defect vectors instead.
    ! So, set up a filter chain that filters the defect vector
    ! during the solution process to implement discrete boundary conditions.
    RfilterChain(1)%ifilterType = FILTER_DISCBCDEFREAL

    ! Create a BiCGStab-solver. Attach the above filter chain
    ! to the solver, so that the solver automatically filters
    ! the vector during the solution process.
    p_RfilterChain => RfilterChain
    NULLIFY(p_rpreconditioner)
    !CALL linsol_initBiCGStab (p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner,p_RfilterChain)
    CALL linsol_initUMFPACK4 (p_rsolverNode)

    ! Set the output level of the solver to 2 for some output
    p_rsolverNode%ioutputLevel = 2

    ! Attach the system matrix to the solver.
    ! First create an array with the matrix data (on all levels, but we
    ! only have one level here), then call the initialisation
    ! routine to attach all these matrices.
    ! Remark: Don't make a call like
    !    CALL linsol_setMatrices(p_RsolverNode,(/p_rmatrix/))
    ! This doesn't work on all compilers, since the compiler would have
    ! to create a temp array on the stack - which does not always work!
    Rmatrices = (/rmatrixBlock/)
    CALL linsol_setMatrices(p_RsolverNode,Rmatrices)

    ! Initialise structure/data of the solver. This allows the
    ! solver to allocate memory / perform some precalculation
    ! to the problem.
    CALL linsol_initStructure (p_rsolverNode, ierror)
    IF (ierror .NE. LINSOL_ERR_NOERROR) STOP
    CALL linsol_initData (p_rsolverNode, ierror)
    IF (ierror .NE. LINSOL_ERR_NOERROR) STOP

    ! Finally solve the system. As we want to solve Ax=b with
    ! b being the real RHS and x being the real solution vector,
    ! we use linsol_solveAdaptively. If b is a defect
    ! RHS and x a defect update to be added to a solution vector,
    ! we would have to use linsol_precondDefect instead.
    CALL linsol_solveAdaptively (p_rsolverNode,rvectorBlock,rrhsBlock,rtempBlock)

    ! Solution vector projection for projecting a solution vector of
    ! an arbitrary element to Q1 such that it can be written into a GMV file
    ! -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ! Now, Our vector block is off the way GMV's style. We need to convert the vector
    ! to Q1 as that is the format, GMV's understands. So the task is to 
    ! create a Q1 solution from rvectorBlock.
    !
    ! Step 1: Create a discretisation structure for Q1, based on our

    ! Step 2: Setup a new solution vector based on this discretisation,
    ! allocate memory.
    CALL lsysbl_createVecBlockByDiscr (rprjDiscretisation,rprjVector,.FALSE.)
 
    ! Step 3: Take the original solution vector and convert it according to the
    ! new discretisation:
    CALL spdp_projectSolution(rvectorBlock,rprjVector)

    ! Step 4: Discretise the boundary condition according to the Q1
    ! discretisation:

    CALL bcasm_discretiseBC (rprjDiscretisation,p_rdiscreteBC_Q1, &
                            .FALSE.,getBoundaryValues)
                            
    ! Connect the vector to the BC's
    rprjVector%p_rdiscreteBC => p_rdiscreteBC_Q1

    ! Step 5: Set up a boundary condition filter for Dirichtley boundary conditions
    ! and pass the vetor through it. This finally implement the Dirichtley 
    ! boundary conditions into the output vector
    RfilterChain(1)%ifilterType = FILTER_DISCBCSOLREAL
    CALL filter_applyFilterChainVec (rprjVector, RfilterChain)

    ! Now we have a Q1 solution in rprjVector.
    !
    ! Step 6: Write the GMV file.
    ! That's it, rvectorBlock now contains our solution in GMV's style. 
    ! We can now start the postprocessing. 
      
    ! Call the GMV library to write out a GMV file for our solution.
