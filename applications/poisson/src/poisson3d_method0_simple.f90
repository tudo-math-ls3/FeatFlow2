    ! Definitions of variables.
    !
    ! We need a couple of variables for this problem. Let us see...
    !
    ! An object for saving the triangulation on the domain
    type(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation

    ! Path to the mesh
    character(len=SYS_STRLEN) :: spredir

    ! An object specifying the discretisation.
    ! This contains also information about trial/test functions,...
    type(t_blockDiscretisation) :: rdiscretisation
    
    ! A bilinear and linear form describing the analytic problem to solve
    type(t_bilinearForm) :: rform
    type(t_linearForm) :: rlinform
    
    ! A scalar matrix and vector. The vector accepts the RHS of the problem
    ! in scalar form.
    type(t_matrixScalar) :: rmatrix
    type(t_vectorScalar) :: rrhs

    ! A block matrix and a couple of block vectors. These will be filled
    ! with data for the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock) :: rmatrixBlock
    type(t_vectorBlock) :: rvectorBlock,rrhsBlock,rtempBlock

    ! An object for saving the boundary mesh region
    type(t_meshregion) :: rmeshRegion

    ! A variable describing the discrete boundary conditions.
    type(t_discreteBC), target :: rdiscreteBC

    ! A solver node that accepts parameters for the linear solver
    type(t_linsolNode), pointer :: p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner

    ! An array for the system matrix(matrices) during the initialisation of
    ! the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock), dimension(1) :: Rmatrices

    ! A filter chain that describes how to filter the matrix/vector
    ! before/during the solution process. The filters usually implement
    ! boundary conditions.
    type(t_filterChain), dimension(1), target :: RfilterChain
    
    ! NLMAX receives the level where we want to solve.
    integer :: NLMAX
    
    ! Error indicator during initialisation of the solver
    integer :: ierror
    
    ! Error of FE function to reference function
    real(DP) :: derror
    
    ! Output block for UCD output to GMV file
    type(t_ucdExport) :: rexport
    character(len=SYS_STRLEN) :: sucddir
    real(DP), dimension(:), pointer :: p_Ddata

    ! Ok, let us start.
    !
    ! We want to solve our Poisson problem on level...
    NLMAX = 4
    
    ! Get the path $PREDIR from the environment, where to read .prm/.tri files
    ! from. If that does not exist, write to the directory "./pre".
    if (.not. sys_getenv_string("PREDIR", spredir)) spredir = './pre'

    ! At first, read in the basic triangulation.
    call tria_readTriFile3D (rtriangulation, trim(spredir)//'/CUBE.tri')
    
    ! Refine it.
    call tria_quickRefine2LevelOrdering (NLMAX-1,rtriangulation)
    
    ! And create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation.
    call tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation)
    
    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies the blocks in the
    ! solution vector. In this simple problem, we only have one block.
    call spdiscr_initBlockDiscr (rdiscretisation,1,&
                                 rtriangulation)
    
    ! rdiscretisation%Rdiscretisations is a list of scalar discretisation
    ! structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! Initialise the first element of the list to specify the element
    ! and cubature rule for this solution component:
    call spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1), &
                                   EL_Q1_3D,CUB_G3_3D,rtriangulation)
                 
    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create a scalar matrix, based on the discretisation structure
    ! for our one and only solution component.
    call bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9,rmatrix)
    
    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 3D.

    rform%itermCount = 3
    rform%Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_DERIV3D_X
    rform%Idescriptors(2,1) = DER_DERIV3D_X
    rform%Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_DERIV3D_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV3D_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(1,3) = DER_DERIV3D_Z
    rform%Idescriptors(2,3) = DER_DERIV3D_Z

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .true.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .true.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0
    rform%Dcoefficients(3)  = 1.0

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical
    ! data.
    call bilf_buildMatrixScalar (rform,.true.,rmatrix,coeff_Laplace_3D)

    ! The same has to be done for the right hand side of the problem.
    ! At first set up the corresponding linear form (f,Phi_j):
    rlinform%itermCount = 1
    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC3D
    
    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to get a discrete version of it.
    ! Again we simply create a scalar vector based on the one and only
    ! discretisation structure.
    ! This scalar vector will later be used as the one and only first
    ! component in a block vector.
    call linf_buildVectorScalar (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                 rlinform,.true.,rrhs,coeff_RHS_3D)
    
    ! The linear solver only works for block matrices/vectors - but above,
    ! we created scalar ones. So the next step is to make a 1x1 block
    ! system from the matrices/vectors above which the linear solver
    ! understands.
    call lsysbl_createMatFromScalar (rmatrix,rmatrixBlock,rdiscretisation)
    call lsysbl_createVecFromScalar (rrhs,rrhsBlock,rdiscretisation)
    
    ! Now we have the raw problem. What is missing is the definition of the boundary
    ! conditions.
    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a `filter technique with
    ! discretised boundary conditions`. This means, we first have to calculate
    ! a discrete version of the analytic BC, which we can implement into the
    ! solution/RHS vectors using the corresponding filter.
    
    ! In contrast to the 2D examples, we currently do not have an analytic
    ! description of the domain`s boundary, therefore we need a discrete
    ! (mesh-dependent) description of the mesh`s boundary. This can be done
    ! using mesh-regions.
    !
    ! Create a t_discreteBC structure where we store all discretised boundary
    ! conditions.
    call bcasm_initDiscreteBC(rdiscreteBC)
    
    ! Create a mesh region describing the mesh`s boundary based on the
    ! nodal-property-array of the current triangulation.
    call mshreg_createFromNodalProp(rmeshRegion, rtriangulation, MSHREG_IDX_ALL)
    
    ! Describe Dirichlet BCs on that mesh region
    call bcasm_newDirichletBConMR(rdiscretisation, 1, rdiscreteBC, rmeshRegion,&
                                  getBoundaryValuesMR_3D)
    
    ! Free the mesh region structure as we will not need it anymore
    call mshreg_done(rmeshRegion)
    
    ! Hang the pointer into the vector and matrix. That way, these
    ! boundary conditions are always connected to that matrix and that
    ! vector.
    rmatrixBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => rdiscreteBC
    rrhsBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => rdiscreteBC
                             
    ! Now we have block vectors for the RHS and the matrix. What we
    ! need additionally is a block vector for the solution and
    ! temporary data. Create them using the RHS as template.
    ! Fill the solution vector with 0:
    call lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rvectorBlock, .true.)
    call lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rtempBlock, .false.)
    
    ! Next step is to implement boundary conditions into the RHS,
    ! solution and matrix. This is done using a vector/matrix filter
    ! for discrete boundary conditions.
    ! The discrete boundary conditions are already attached to the
    ! vectors/matrix. Call the appropriate vector/matrix filter that
    ! modifies the vectors/matrix according to the boundary conditions.
    call vecfil_discreteBCrhs (rrhsBlock)
    call vecfil_discreteBCsol (rvectorBlock)
    call matfil_discreteBC (rmatrixBlock)

    ! During the linear solver, the boundary conditions are also
    ! frequently imposed to the vectors. But as the linear solver
    ! does not work with the actual solution vectors but with
    ! defect vectors instead.
    ! So, set up a filter chain that filters the defect vector
    ! during the solution process to implement discrete boundary conditions.
    RfilterChain(1)%ifilterType = FILTER_DISCBCDEFREAL

    ! Create a BiCGStab-solver. Attach the above filter chain
    ! to the solver, so that the solver automatically filters
    ! the vector during the solution process.
    nullify(p_rpreconditioner)
    call linsol_initBiCGStab (p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner,RfilterChain)
    
    ! Set the output level of the solver to 2 for some output
    p_rsolverNode%ioutputLevel = 2
    
    ! Attach the system matrix to the solver.
    ! First create an array with the matrix data (on all levels, but we
    ! only have one level here), then call the initialisation
    ! routine to attach all these matrices.
    ! Remark: Do not make a call like
    !    CALL linsol_setMatrices(p_RsolverNode,(/p_rmatrix/))
    ! This does not work on all compilers, since the compiler would have
    ! to create a temp array on the stack - which does not always work!
    Rmatrices = (/rmatrixBlock/)
    call linsol_setMatrices(p_RsolverNode,Rmatrices)
    
    ! Initialise structure/data of the solver. This allows the
    ! solver to allocate memory / perform some precalculation
    ! to the problem.
    call linsol_initStructure (p_rsolverNode, ierror)
    if (ierror .ne. LINSOL_ERR_NOERROR) stop
    call linsol_initData (p_rsolverNode, ierror)
    if (ierror .ne. LINSOL_ERR_NOERROR) stop
    
    ! Finally solve the system. As we want to solve Ax=b with
    ! b being the real RHS and x being the real solution vector,
    ! we use linsol_solveAdaptively. If b is a defect
    ! RHS and x a defect update to be added to a solution vector,
    ! we would have to use linsol_precondDefect instead.
    call linsol_solveAdaptively (p_rsolverNode,rvectorBlock,rrhsBlock,rtempBlock)
    
    ! That is it, rvectorBlock now contains our solution. We can now
    ! start the postprocessing.
    !
    ! Get the path for writing postprocessing files from the environment variable
    ! $UCDDIR. If that does not exist, write to the directory "./gmv".

    ! Write the file to disc, that is it.
    call ucd_write (rexport)

    ! Calculate the error to the reference function.

    ! We are finished - but not completely!
    ! Now, clean up so that all the memory is available again.
