!# This module is a demonstration program how to solve a simple Poisson
!# problem with constant coefficients on a simple domain.
!#
!# For simplicity, this example application is derived from 
!# poisson2d_method0_simple.
!#
!# The boundary is like in the other applications. Additionally, inside of the 
!# domain a fictitious boundary component is placed that introduces
!# Dirichlet-0 values in a couple of cells. For this purpose, an additional
!# callback routine getBoundaryValuesFBC is used that gives an analytical
!# description of the object and returns the values inside of the
!# object to the discretisation framework.

    ! Definitions of variables.
    !
    ! We need a couple of variables for this problem. Let's see...
    !
    ! An object for saving the domain:
    TYPE(t_boundary), POINTER :: p_rboundary
    
    ! An object for saving the triangulation on the domain
    TYPE(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation

    ! An object specifying the discretisation.
    ! This contains also information about trial/test functions,...

    ! A bilinear and linear form describing the analytic problem to solve
    TYPE(t_bilinearForm) :: rform
    TYPE(t_linearForm) :: rlinform
    
    ! A scalar matrix and vector. The vector accepts the RHS of the problem
    ! in scalar form.
    TYPE(t_matrixScalar) :: rmatrix
    TYPE(t_vectorScalar) :: rrhs

    ! A block matrix and a couple of block vectors. These will be filled
    ! with data for the linear solver.
    TYPE(t_matrixBlock) :: rmatrixBlock

    ! the linear solver.
    TYPE(t_matrixBlock), DIMENSION(1) :: Rmatrices

    ! A filter chain that describes how to filter the matrix/vector
    ! before/during the solution process. The filters usually implement
    ! boundary conditions.
    TYPE(t_filterChain), DIMENSION(2), TARGET :: RfilterChain
    TYPE(t_filterChain), DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: p_RfilterChain
    
    ! NLMAX receives the level where we want to solve.

    REAL(DP), DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: p_Ddata
    
    ! Output block for UCD output to GMV file
    TYPE(t_ucdExport) :: rexport

    ! Ok, let's start. 
    !
    ! We want to solve our Poisson problem on level...
    NLMAX = 7
    
    ! At first, read in the parametrisation of the boundary and save
    ! it to rboundary.
    ! Set p_rboundary to NULL to create a new structure on the heap.
    NULLIFY(p_rboundary)
    CALL boundary_read_prm(p_rboundary, './pre/QUAD.prm')
        
    ! Now read in the basic triangulation.
    CALL tria_readTriFile2D (rtriangulation, './pre/QUAD.tri', p_rboundary)
    
    ! Refine it.
    CALL tria_quickRefine2LevelOrdering (NLMAX-1,rtriangulation,p_rboundary)
    
    ! And create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation.
    CALL tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation,p_rboundary)
    
    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies the blocks in the
    ! solution vector. In this simple problem, we only have one block.
    CALL spdiscr_initBlockDiscr2D (rdiscretisation,1,&
                                   rtriangulation, p_rboundary)
    
    ! rdiscretisation%Rdiscretisations is a list of scalar discretisation
    ! structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! Initialise the first element of the list to specify the element
    ! and cubature rule for this solution component:
    CALL spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscretisation(1), &

    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create a scalar matrix, based on the discretisation structure
    ! for our one and only solution component.
    CALL bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscretisation(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9,rmatrix)
    
    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 2D.
    
    rform%itermCount = 2
    rform%Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_DERIV_X

    rform%Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_DERIV_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV_Y

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .TRUE.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .TRUE.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0 
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0 

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical
    ! data.
    CALL bilf_buildMatrixScalar (rform,.TRUE.,rmatrix,coeff_Laplace_2D)
    
    ! The same has to be done for the right hand side of the problem.
    ! At first set up the corresponding linear form (f,Phi_j):
    rlinform%itermCount = 1
    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC
    
    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to get a discrete version of it.
    ! Again we simply create a scalar vector based on the one and only
    ! discretisation structure.
    ! This scalar vector will later be used as the one and only first
    ! component in a block vector.

    ! The linear solver only works for block matrices/vectors - but above,
    ! we created scalar ones. So the next step is to make a 1x1 block
    ! system from the matrices/vectors above which the linear solver
    ! understands.
    CALL lsysbl_createMatFromScalar (rmatrix,rmatrixBlock,rdiscretisation)
    CALL lsysbl_createVecFromScalar (rrhs,rrhsBlock,rdiscretisation)
    
    ! Now we have the raw problem. What is missing is the definition of the boudary
    ! conditions.
    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a 'filter technique with
    ! discretised boundary conditions'. This means, we first have to calculate
    ! a discrete version of the analytic BC, which we can implement into the
    ! solution/RHS vectors using the corresponding filter.
    !
    ! Create a t_discreteBC structure where we store all discretised boundary
    ! conditions.
    CALL bcasm_initDiscreteBC(rdiscreteBC)
    !
    ! We 'know' already (from the problem definition) that we have four boundary
    ! segments in the domain. Each of these, we want to use for enforcing
    ! some kind of boundary condition.
    !
    ! We ask the bondary routines to create a 'boundary region' - which is
    ! simply a part of the boundary corresponding to a boundary segment.
    ! A boundary region roughly contains the type, the min/max parameter value
    ! and whether the endpoints are inside the region or not.
    CALL boundary_createRegion(p_rboundary,1,1,rboundaryRegion)
    
    ! We use this boundary region and specify that we want to have Dirichlet
    ! boundary there. The following call does the following:
    ! - Create Dirichlet boundary conditions on the region rboundaryRegion.
    !   We specify icomponent='1' to indicate that we set up the
    !   Dirichlet BC's for the first (here: one and only) component in the 
    !   solution vector.
    ! - Discretise the boundary condition so that the BC's can be applied
    !   to matrices and vectors
    ! - Add the calculated discrete BC's to rdiscreteBC for later use.
