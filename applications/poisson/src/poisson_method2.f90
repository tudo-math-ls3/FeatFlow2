!# This module is a demonstation program how to solve a simple Laplace

!#
!# The routine splits up the tasks of reading the domain, creating

!# different subroutines. The communication between these subroutines
!# is done using a collection structure that saves problem-dependent data.

  ! This is a 'separated' poisson solver for solving a Poisson
  ! problem. The different tasks of the problem are separated into
  ! subroutines. The problem uses a collection structure for the communication:
  ! All subroutines add their generated information to the collection, so that
  ! the other subroutines can work with them. 
  !
  ! The following tasks are performed by the subroutines:
  !
  ! 1.) Read in parametrisation
  ! 2.) Read in triangulation
  ! 3.) Set up RHS
  ! 4.) Set up matrix
  ! 5.) Create solver structure
  ! 6.) Solve the problem
  ! 7.) Write solution to GMV file
  ! 8.) Release all variables, finish
