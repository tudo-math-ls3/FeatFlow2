    ! Definitions of variables.
    !
    ! We need a couple of variables for this problem. Let us see...
    !
    ! An object for saving the triangulation on the domain
    type(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation
    
    ! An object for saving the boundary mesh region
    type(t_meshregion) :: rmeshRegion

    ! An object specifying the discretisation.
    ! This contains also information about trial/test functions,...
    type(t_blockDiscretisation) :: rdiscretisation
    
    ! A bilinear and linear form describing the analytic problem to solve
    type(t_bilinearForm) :: rform
    type(t_linearForm) :: rlinform
    
    ! A scalar matrix and vector. The vector accepts the RHS of the problem
    ! in scalar form.
    type(t_matrixScalar) :: rmatrix
    type(t_vectorScalar) :: rrhs

    ! A block matrix and a couple of block vectors. These will be filled
    ! with data for the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock) :: rmatrixBlock
    type(t_vectorBlock) :: rvectorBlock,rrhsBlock,rtempBlock

    ! A set of variables describing the analytic and discrete boundary
    ! conditions.    
    type(t_discreteBC), target :: rdiscreteBC

    ! A solver node that accepts parameters for the linear solver    
    type(t_linsolNode), pointer :: p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner

    ! An array for the system matrix(matrices) during the initialisation of
    ! the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock), dimension(1) :: Rmatrices

    ! A filter chain that describes how to filter the matrix/vector
    ! before/during the solution process. The filters usually implement
    ! boundary conditions.
    type(t_filterChain), dimension(1), target :: RfilterChain
    
    ! Error indicator during initialisation of the solver
    integer :: ierror    
    
    ! Error of FE function to reference function
    real(DP) :: derror

    ! Output block for UCD output to GMV file
    type(t_ucdExport) :: rexport
    character(len=SYS_STRLEN) :: sucddir
    real(DP), dimension(:), pointer :: p_Ddata

    ! The number of sub-intervals for the discretisation
    integer :: nintervals = 16
    
    ! Ok, let us start. 
    ! At first, create the basic triangulation.
    ! Our domain is [0, 1], divided into nintervals sub-intervals.
    call tria_createRawTria1D(rtriangulation, 0.0_DP, 1.0_DP, nintervals)
    
    ! As the tria_createRawTria1D routine always generates a grid
    ! with sub-intervals of equal length, we can optionally disturb
    ! the mesh.
    !CALL meshmod_disturbMesh(rtriangulation, 0.2_DP)

    ! And create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation.
    call tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation)
    
    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies the blocks in the
    ! solution vector. In this simple problem, we only have one block.
    call spdiscr_initBlockDiscr (rdiscretisation, 1, rtriangulation)
    
    ! In the next step, we will define the element type and the cubature
    ! formula that is to be used. For this 1D poisson-example we currently
    ! have 2 possible element types: linear and quadratic ones.
    ! For linear elements the trapezoidal formula satisfies all our
    ! needs, for quadratic elements we should choose a 3-point Gauss-formula.
    !
    ! rdiscretisation%Rdiscretisations is a list of scalar discretisation
    ! structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! Initialise the first element of the list to specify the element
    ! and cubature rule for this solution component:
    call spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1), &
    ! Setting up a linear element and trapezoidal rule would be...
                                   EL_P1_1D,CUB_TRZ_1D,rtriangulation)
    ! Setting up a quadratic element and 3-point Gauss rule would be...
                                   !EL_P2_1D,CUB_G3_1D,rtriangulation)
    ! Setting up a cubic spline element and 4-point Gauss rule would be...
                                   !EL_S31_1D,CUB_G4_1D,rtriangulation)
                                   
    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create a scalar matrix, based on the discretisation structure
    ! for our one and only solution component.
    call bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9,rmatrix)
    
    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 1D.
    rform%itermCount = 1
    rform%Idescriptors(1,1) = DER_DERIV_X
    rform%Idescriptors(2,1) = DER_DERIV_X

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .true.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .true.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = 1.0 
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = 1.0 

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical
    ! data.
    call bilf_buildMatrixScalar (rform,.true.,rmatrix,coeff_Laplace_1D)
    
    ! The same has to be done for the right hand side of the problem.
    ! At first set up the corresponding linear form (f,Phi_j):
    rlinform%itermCount = 1
    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC
    
    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to get a discrete version of it.
    ! Again we simply create a scalar vector based on the one and only
    ! discretisation structure.
    ! This scalar vector will later be used as the one and only first
    ! component in a block vector.
    call linf_buildVectorScalar (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                 rlinform,.true.,rrhs,coeff_RHS_1D)
    
    ! The linear solver only works for block matrices/vectors - but above,
    ! we created scalar ones. So the next step is to make a 1x1 block
    ! system from the matrices/vectors above which the linear solver
    ! understands.
    call lsysbl_createMatFromScalar (rmatrix,rmatrixBlock,rdiscretisation)
    call lsysbl_createVecFromScalar (rrhs,rrhsBlock,rdiscretisation)
    
    ! Now we have the raw problem. What is missing is the definition of the boundary
    ! conditions.
    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a `filter technique with
    ! discretised boundary conditions`. This means, we first have to calculate
    ! a discrete version of the analytic BC, which we can implement into the
    ! solution/RHS vectors using the corresponding filter.
    !
    ! In contrast to the 2D poisson examples, we will directly set the
    ! dirichlet boundary conditions by hand instead of discretising an analytic
    ! boundary condition function using a boundary structure.
    !
    ! Initialise the structure that collects the discrete BC`s:
    call bcasm_initDiscreteBC(rdiscreteBC)

    ! In 1D we have 2 possibilities to describe Dirichlet BCs on the interval
    ! ends. One possibility is to use the bcasm_initDirichletBC_1D routine.
    ! The following call would prescribe 0 on both interval ends:
    !
    ! CALL bcasm_newDirichletBC_1D(rdiscretisation, rdiscreteBC, 0.0_DP, 0.0_DP)
    !
    ! The second possibility is using mesh regions:
    !
    ! Create a mesh region describing the mesh`s boundary based on the
    ! nodal-property-array of the current triangulation.
    call mshreg_createFromNodalProp(rmeshRegion, rtriangulation, &
                                      MSHREG_IDX_ALL)
    
    ! Describe Dirichlet BCs on that mesh region
    call bcasm_newDirichletBConMR(rdiscretisation, 1, rdiscreteBC, rmeshRegion,&
                                  getBoundaryValuesMR_1D)
    
    ! Free the mesh region structure as we will not need it anymore
    call mshreg_done(rmeshRegion)
    
    ! Hang the pointer into the vector and matrix. That way, these
    ! boundary conditions are always connected to that matrix and that
    ! vector.
    rmatrixBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => rdiscreteBC
    rrhsBlock%p_rdiscreteBC => rdiscreteBC
                             
    ! Now we have block vectors for the RHS and the matrix. What we
    ! need additionally is a block vector for the solution and
    ! temporary data. Create them using the RHS as template.
    ! Fill the solution vector with 0:
    call lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rvectorBlock, .true.)
    call lsysbl_createVecBlockIndirect (rrhsBlock, rtempBlock, .false.)
    
    ! Next step is to implement boundary conditions into the RHS,
    ! solution and matrix. This is done using a vector/matrix filter
    ! for discrete boundary conditions.
    ! The discrete boundary conditions are already attached to the
    ! vectors/matrix. Call the appropriate vector/matrix filter that
    ! modifies the vectors/matrix according to the boundary conditions.
    call vecfil_discreteBCrhs (rrhsBlock)
    call vecfil_discreteBCsol (rvectorBlock)
    call matfil_discreteBC (rmatrixBlock)

    ! During the linear solver, the boundary conditions are also
    ! frequently imposed to the vectors. But as the linear solver
    ! does not work with the actual solution vectors but with
    ! defect vectors instead.
    ! So, set up a filter chain that filters the defect vector
    ! during the solution process to implement discrete boundary conditions.
    RfilterChain(1)%ifilterType = FILTER_DISCBCDEFREAL

    ! Attach the above filter chain to the solver, so that the solver
    ! automatically filters the vector during the solution process!
    !    
    ! We now have the option to create a preconditioner for the solver.

    ! Preconditioner Remark:
    ! ----------------------
    ! Please keep in mind that if the 1D grid for the discretisation was
    ! created using the tria_createRawTria1D routine (which is the default
    ! case in this example) and the grid was NOT refined afterwards (which is
    ! also the default case in this example), the resulting matrix will be
    ! tri-diagonal for linear elements.
    ! In this case, a LU-decomposition would produce no fill-in - therefore the
    ! ILU(0) preconditioner computes a complete LU-decomposition of the system
    ! matrix. So do not wonder if you set ILU(0) as a preconditioner and the
    ! solver always converges after 1 iteration... ^_^
