!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the Poisson problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# --- 3D version ---
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Laplace_3D
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_3D
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Laplace
!#        equation for the 1D poisson-problem (i.e. poisson0). 3D case.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) getBoundaryValues_3D
!#     -> Returns analytic values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_bcassembly.inc'
!#
!# 4.) getBoundaryValuesMR_3D
!#     -> Returns discrete values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_discretebc.inc'
!#
!# 5.) getReferenceFunction_3D
!#     -> Returns the values of the analytic function and its derivatives,
!#        corresponding to coeff_RHS_3D for the 3D poisson-problem.
!#     -> Is only used for the postprocessing to calculate the $L_2$- and
!#        $H_1$-error of the FE function in comparison to the analytic
!#        function

  ! This array receives the calculated information. If the caller
  ! only needs one value, the computed quantity is put into Dvalues(1). 
  ! If multiple values are needed, they are collected here (e.g. for 
  ! DISCBC_NEEDDERIV: Dvalues(1)=x-derivative, Dvalues(2)=y-derivative,...)
  !
  ! The function may return SYS_INFINITY as a value. This indicates the
  ! framework to ignore the node and treat it as 'natural boundary condition'
  ! node.
