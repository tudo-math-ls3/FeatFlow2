# Preconditioner in nonlinear defect correction

# Type of preconditioner to use in nonlinear defect correction.
# =0: Preconditioning with inverse mass matrix (not yet implemented).
# =1: Preconditioning by defect correction loop, using a linear solver
#     to solve the linearised system.
# =2: Preconditioning by Newton-Iteration.
#     This is a combination of a linear solver (itypePreconditioning=1)
#     in conjunction with an extended matrix to improve convergence speed
#     (at the cost of assembly time).
# =3: Preconditioning by adaptive Newton-Iteration.
#     This is a defect correction iteration that switches automatically
#     to the Newton iteration if an error criterion is fulfilled for the
#     residual. The parameter spreconditionerAdaptiveNewton below defines
#     the name of a section that specifies the parameters for the dynamic
#     switching.
# Note: Currently, Newton only works with quadratic convergence if 
# the stabilisation is deactivated (iUpwind=0, dUpsam=0.0)!!!

# The following section describes the parameters of the Newton iteration.
# For the use of Newton, an extended matrix must be generated.
# Furthermore, a combination of Newton and the usual defect correction
# approach can be configured here, as Newton may fail if the current
# iterate of the nonlinear solver is 'too far away' from the solution-
