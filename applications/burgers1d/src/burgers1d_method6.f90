!# <purpose>
!# This module is a demonstation program how to solve a 1D Burgers equation
!# simultaneously in space/time. 
!#
!# The 1D burgers equation in space/time is defined by:
!#
!#    $$  u_t  +  u*u_x  -  \nu u_xx  =  0,   u(x,0) = sin(Pi*x)  $$
!#
!# We solve this equation in the space/time domain
!# $(x,t) \in \Omega=[0,1]x[0,1]$. In this example, we use a direct space-time
!# discretisation, i.e. we do not use a separate time-discretisation.
!# Instead, we replace the $t$ variable by $y$-variable of a usual
!# 2D space discretisation, thus resulting in the formula
!#
!#    $$  u_y  +  u*u_x  -  \nu u_xx  =  0,   u(x,0) = sin(Pi*x)  $$
!#
!# For Solving this in the domain $\Omega$, we follow the usual w3ay:
!# The tasks of reading the domain, creating triangulations, discretisation,
!# solving, postprocessing and creanup into different subroutines. 
!# The communication between these subroutines is done using an 
!# application-specific structure saving problem data.
!#
!# As this problem is nonlinear, we need to invoke a nonlinear solver,
!# which uses a couple of application-spcific callback routines.
!# To provide these routines with necessary data, we build up a collection 
!# structure. This is passed through the solver to the callback routines.
!#
!# The preconditioning in this example is done by a Multigrid solver,
!# which performs only a few number of steps, so does not iterate till
!# convergence.
