!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the Burgers-1D problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_burgers
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the System matrix. As the Burgers
!#        equation needs to build a linearised nonlinear matrix,
!#        this routine has to evaluate a FE function and use the FE values
!#        as coefficients in the system matrix.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Laplace
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analitical values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_bcassembly.inc'
