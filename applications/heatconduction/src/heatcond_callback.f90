!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the poisson problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in "intf_xxxx.inc" files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Laplace
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc"
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Laplace
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 3.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analitical values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_bcassembly.inc"
