!# This module contains callback functions for the cc2d-mini problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Stokes
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Pressure
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the pressure matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_x
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the X-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) coeff_RHS_y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Y-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 4.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analitical values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_bcassembly.inc'
