    ! Definitions of variables.
    !
    ! We need a couple of variables for this problem. Let's see...
    !
    ! An object for saving the domain:
    type(t_boundary) :: rboundary

    ! An object for saving the triangulation on the domain
    type(t_triangulation) :: rtriangulation

    ! An object specifying the discretisation.
    ! This contains also information about trial/test functions,...
    type(t_blockDiscretisation) :: rdiscretisation,rprjDiscretisation
    
    ! A bilinear and linear form describing the analytic problem to solve
    type(t_bilinearForm) :: rform
    type(t_linearForm) :: rlinform

    ! A scalar matrix and vector. The vector accepts the RHS of the problem
    ! in scalar form.
    type(t_matrixScalar) :: rmatrixB1, rmatrixB2

    ! A block matrix and a couple of block vectors. These will be filled
    ! with data for the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock) :: rmatrix
    type(t_vectorBlock) :: rvector,rrhs,rtempBlock,rprjVector
    
    ! A set of variables describing the analytic and discrete boundary
    ! conditions.    
    type(t_boundaryRegion) :: rboundaryRegion
    type(t_discreteBC), target :: rdiscreteBC, rprjDiscreteBC

    ! A solver node that accepts parameters for the linear solver    
    type(t_linsolNode), pointer :: p_rsolverNode,p_rpreconditioner

    ! An array for the system matrix(matrices) during the initialisation of
    ! the linear solver.
    type(t_matrixBlock), dimension(1) :: Rmatrices

    ! A filter chain that describes how to filter the matrix/vector
    ! before/during the solution process. The filters usually implement
    ! boundary conditions.
    type(t_filterChain), dimension(1), target :: RfilterChain
    type(t_filterChain), dimension(:), pointer :: p_RfilterChain
    
    ! NLMAX receives the level where we want to solve.
    integer :: NLMAX
    
    ! Viscosity parameter nu = 1/Re
    real(DP) :: dnu
    
    ! Error indicator during initialisation of the solver
    integer :: ierror    
    
    ! Output block for UCD output to GMV file
    type(t_ucdExport) :: rexport
    real(DP), dimension(:), pointer :: p_Ddata,p_Ddata2

    ! Ok, let's start. 
    !
    ! We want to solve our Poisson problem on level...
    ! As we do not use a multigrid solver here, we'll set the level
    ! to 5 instead of 7.
    NLMAX = 5
    
    ! Viscosity parameter:
    dnu = 1.0_DP

    ! At first, read in the parametrisation of the boundary and save
    ! it to rboundary.
    call boundary_read_prm(rboundary, './pre/QUAD.prm')
        
    ! Now read in the basic triangulation.
    call tria_readTriFile2D (rtriangulation, './pre/QUAD.tri', rboundary)
    
    ! Refine the mesh up to the minimum level
    call tria_quickRefine2LevelOrdering(NLMAX-1,rtriangulation,rboundary)
    
    ! Create information about adjacencies and everything one needs from
    ! a triangulation. Afterwards, we have the coarse mesh.
    call tria_initStandardMeshFromRaw (rtriangulation,rboundary)

    ! Now we can start to initialise the discretisation. At first, set up
    ! a block discretisation structure that specifies 3 blocks in the
    ! solution vector.
    call spdiscr_initBlockDiscr (rdiscretisation,3,&
                                 rtriangulation, rboundary)

    ! rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr is a list of scalar 
    ! discretisation structures for every component of the solution vector.
    ! We have a solution vector with three components:
    !  Component 1 = X-velocity
    !  Component 2 = Y-velocity
    !  Component 3 = Pressure
    ! For simplicity, we set up one discretisation structure for the 
    ! velocity...
    call spdiscr_initDiscr_simple (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                EL_EM30, CUB_G2X2, rtriangulation, rboundary)
                
    ! ...and copy this structure also to the discretisation structure
    ! of the 2nd component (Y-velocity). This needs no additional memory, 
    ! as both structures will share the same dynamic information afterwards.
    call spdiscr_duplicateDiscrSc(rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
        rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(2))

    ! For the pressure (3rd component), we set up a separate discretisation 
    ! structure, as this uses different finite elements for trial and test
    ! functions.
    call spdiscr_deriveSimpleDiscrSc (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1), &
        EL_Q0, CUB_G2X2, rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(3))

    ! Initialise the block matrix with default values based on
    ! the discretisation.
    call lsysbl_createMatBlockByDiscr (rdiscretisation,rmatrix)    
    
    ! Inform the matrix that we build a saddle-point problem.
    ! Normally, imatrixSpec has the value LSYSBS_MSPEC_GENERAL,
    ! but probably some solvers can use the special structure later.
    rmatrix%imatrixSpec = LSYSBS_MSPEC_SADDLEPOINT
    
    ! Now as the discretisation is set up, we can start to generate
    ! the structure of the system matrix which is to solve.
    ! We create that directly in the block (1,1) of the block matrix
    ! using the discretisation structure of the first block.
    !
    ! Create the matrix structure of the X-velocity.
    call bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9, rmatrix%RmatrixBlock(1,1))

    ! In the Stokes problem, the matrix for the Y-velocity is identical to
    ! the matrix for the X-velocity; both are Laplace-matrices!
    ! Therefore, we can simply make a copy of the matrix for the X-velocity.
    ! This we do later after the entries are created.
    !
    ! In the global system, there are two coupling matrices B1 and B2.
    ! Both have the same structure.
    !
    !    ( A         B1 )

    !    ( B1^T B2^T    )
    !
    ! Create the matrices structure of the pressure using the 3rd
    ! spatial discretisation structure in p_rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr.
    call bilf_createMatrixStructure (rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(3),&
                                     LSYSSC_MATRIX9, rmatrixB1,&
                                     rdiscretisation%RspatialDiscr(1))
              
    ! Duplicate the B1 matrix structure to the B2 matrix, so use
    ! lsyssc_duplicateMatrix to create B2. Share the matrix 
    ! structure between B1 and B2 (B1 is the parent and B2 the child).

    ! the assembly routines later.
    call lsyssc_duplicateMatrix (rmatrixB1, rmatrixB2, LSYSSC_DUP_COPY,&

    ! And now to the entries of the matrix. For assembling of the entries,
    ! we need a bilinear form, which first has to be set up manually.
    ! We specify the bilinear form (grad Psi_j, grad Phi_i) for the
    ! scalar system matrix in 2D.
    rform%itermCount = 2

    rform%Idescriptors(1,2) = DER_DERIV_Y
    rform%Idescriptors(2,2) = DER_DERIV_Y

    ! In the standard case, we have constant coefficients:
    rform%ballCoeffConstant = .true.
    rform%BconstantCoeff = .true.
    rform%Dcoefficients(1)  = dnu
    rform%Dcoefficients(2)  = dnu

    ! Now we can build the matrix entries.
    ! We specify the callback function coeff_Laplace for the coefficients.
    ! As long as we use constant coefficients, this routine is not used.
    ! By specifying ballCoeffConstant = BconstantCoeff = .FALSE. above,
    ! the framework will call the callback routine to get analytical data.
    !
    ! We pass our collection structure as well to this routine, 
    ! so the callback routine has access to everything what is
    ! in the collection.
    !
    ! Build the X-velocity matrix:

    ! Manually change the discretisation structure of the Y-velocity 
    ! matrix to the Y-discretisation structure.

    ! block matrix, while we create copies of the entries. The reason is
    ! that these matrices are modified for boundary conditions later.

    rlinform%Idescriptors(1) = DER_FUNC
    
    ! ... and then discretise the RHS to the first two subvectors of

    ! For implementing boundary conditions, we use a 'filter technique with

    !

    !   Dirichlet BC's for the first (here: one and only) component in the
