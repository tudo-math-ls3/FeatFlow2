!# This module contains callback functions for the stokes problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in "intf_xxxx.inc" files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Stokes_2D
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc"
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Pressure_2D
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the pressure matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc"
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_X_2D, coeff_RHS_Y_2D
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Laplace
!#        equation -- for the X-velocity as well as for the Y-velocity.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 3.) getBoundaryValues_2D
!#     -> Returns analitical values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.

!<description>
  ! This subroutine is called during the calculation of errors. It has to compute
  ! the (analytical) values of a function in a couple of points on a couple
  ! of elements. These values are compared to those of a computed FE function
  ! and used to calculate an error.
  !
  ! The routine accepts a set of elements and a set of points on these
  ! elements (cubature points) in in real coordinates.
  ! According to the terms in the linear form, the routine has to compute
  ! simultaneously for all these points.

  ! The result must be written to the Dvalue-array below.
