# At first we define a list of expressions that can be evaluated
# on the boundary. The number in braces "(n)" specifies
# how many expressions are defined here. The following n lines define
# n constant values in the form
#   'name' type value
# with
#   'name' : an arbitrary name; case insensitive
#   type   : -2=name of a hardcoded expression realised by callback routines
#               in the code
#            -1=general text expression to be evaluated
#             0=double precision constant, 
#             1=integer constant
#             2=parabolic profile with given maximum value
#   value  : the value associated to the name
#
# The following variables are allowed in an expression:
#    L = local parameter value inside of the boundary region, [0..1].
#    R = parameter value on the boundary, 0-1 parametrisation,
#        relative to the segment (i.e. always starts with 0.0 an
#        ends with 1.0)
#    S = parameter value on the boundary, length parametrisation,
#        relative to the segment (i.e. starts with 0.0 and ends
#        with the segment length)
#    X = x-coordinate of the point on the boundary
#    Y = y-coordinate of the point on the boundary
#    TIME = time in a nonstationary simulation
#    MFVELX = x-velocity of the moving frame (if imovingFrame=1)
#    MFVELY = y-velocity of the moving frame (if imovingFrame=1)
#    MFACCX = x-acceleration of the moving frame (if imovingFrame=1)
#    MFACCY = y-acceleration of the moving frame (if imovingFrame=1)
#    NX     = x-component of the normal vector on the boundary.
#    NY     = Y-component of the normal vector on the boundary.
#
# The following constants are defined:
#
#    _PI    = The number Pi
#    _EXP   = The natural number E
#    _INFTY = infinity
#
# Moreover, all commands from the fparser.f90 are possible here,
# e.g. if, min, max, sin, cos, tan, ceil, floor, exp, log, log10, sqrt,...
#
# Note: An expression defining Dirichlet boundary conditions may return
# _INFTY at some points (x,y) on the boundary. This return value will
# make the corresponding part on the boundary be treated as Neumann
# boundary! Thus by defining an expression relative to a parameter
# value and the time, it's possible to create moving boundary conditions.

# Whether there are Neumann boundary components in the domain.
# =-1 : automatic detection (standard; does not work for moving boundary conditions!)
# =0  : The boundary is pure Dirichlet.
# =1  : There are Neumann or pressure drop boundary segments on the domain.

ineumannBoundary = -1

# For each boundary component, a boundary component specifier
# 'bdComponentX([n])' must exist. [n] defined the number of sub-segments
# that follow. A sub-segment either corresponds to an actual boundary
# segment or is a 'free' boundary segment anywhere on the boundary.
# To each sub-segment, a boundary condition is associated.
#
# Definition of boundary segments always start at parameter value 0.0.
# Each specified sub-segment allows to specify the end parameter
# value of the segment:
# "    4.0  3  [bdcid] ..."
#   Creates a boundary condition segment starting from the 'current' 
#   parameter value, ending at parameter value '4.0'. '3' specifies 
#   that both, starting and ending point should belong to the segment.
#   '1' is the number X of the boundary condition 'bdExpressionX'
#   defined above.
#   Using a parameter value which is larger than the maximum parameter
#   value will result in a 'wrap around', of the boundary condition
#   segment, letting it start at the beginning of the boundary component
#   again.
# The last values in the list "x a [bdcid] ..." have the following 
# meaning:
#  a = 0: Start- and endpoint don't belong to the interval
#    = 1: Include startpoint of the interval
#    = 2: Include endpoint of the interval
#    = 3: Include start- and endpoint
#  [bdcid] = 0 : Do-nothing boundary condition for all directions
#          = 1 : Simple Dirichlet boundary condition for all
#                main solution components (e.g. velocity) component.
#                For every component, an expression identifier follows
#                that defines the value on that part of the boundary.
#                Example:  1.0  3  1  'Dirichlet0'  'Dirichlet0'
#                          2.0  3  1  'Dirichlet1'  'Dirichlet0'
#                Dirichlet-0-values between parameter value 0..1 for X- and
#                Y-velocity. Between parameter value 1..2: Dirichlet-1-value
#                for X-vel., Dirichlet-0-value for Y-vel.
#          = 2 : Pressure-drop / Normal-stress boundary condition.
#                "..." specifies the name of the expression that is
#                evaluated to give the normal stress.
#                Example:  1.0  3  2  'PressValue1'
#          = 3 : Slip boundary conditions. Like Neumann BC's this
#                does not use an expression.
#          = 4 : Inhomogeneous Neumann boundary.
#                Example:  1.0  0  4  'NeumannBdValue'
#
# Note: In the default configuration, the expression name 'AnalyticBC'
#  (as defined above with expression type -2) serves as a trigger for 
#  analytic Dirichlet boundary conditions that use the callback routione 
#  'getBoundaryValues'. Therefore, when the term 'AnalyticBC' is used as 
#  X- or Y-velocity, the routine 'getBoundaryValues' in cccallback.f90 is 
#  called for that segment to return the analytic boundary value!
