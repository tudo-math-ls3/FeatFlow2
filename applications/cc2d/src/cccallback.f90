!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the cc2d-mini problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Stokes
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Pressure
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the pressure matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_x
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the X-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) coeff_RHS_y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Y-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 4.) ffunction_TargetX
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in X-direction.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 5.) ffunction_TargetY
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in Y-direction.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 6.) ffunction_TargetP
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired pressure.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 7.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#
!# 8.) getBoundaryValuesFBC
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the fictitious boundary components
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_fbcassembly.inc'
!#
!# 9.) cc_initCollectForAssembly
!#     -> Is called prior to the assembly process.
!#     -> Stores some information from the problem structure to a collection
!#        such that it can be accessed in callback routines
!#
!# 10.) cc_doneCollectForAssembly
!#      -> Is called after the assembly process.
!#      -> Releases information stored in the collection by 
!#         cc_initCollectForAssembly.
!#
!# For nonstationary simulation, it might be neccessary in these routines
!# to access the current simulation time. Before the assembly process, the cc2d
!# framework calls cc_initCollectForAssembly to stores the current point 
!# in time (and probably other necessary information) to the quickaccess-array
!# in the collection which is passed to the callback routines. The callback
!# routines can access this as follows:
!#
!# -> rcollection%IquickAccess(1)   = 0: stationary, 
!#                                    1: nonstationary with explicit time stepping
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(1)   = current simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(2)   = minimum simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(3)   = maximum simulation time
!#
!# After the assembly, cc_doneCollectForAssembly is called to clean up.
!# Note: Information stored in the quick-access array are of temporary
!# nature and does not have to be cleaned up.
!#
!# </purpose>

    ! This subroutine is called during the discretisation of boundary
    ! conditions on fictitious boundary components. It calculates a special quantity 
    ! on the boundary, which is then used by the discretisation routines to 
    ! generate a discrete 'snapshot' of the (actually analytic) boundary conditions.
    !
    ! The routine must calculate the values on all elements of the element
    ! list Ielements simultaneously. Iwhere is a list with vertex or edge numbers
    ! where information is to be retrieved. Dvalues is filled with function values
    ! while Binside is set to TRUE for every vertex/edge that is inside of the
    ! corresponding fictitious boundary region (identified by rbcRegion).
