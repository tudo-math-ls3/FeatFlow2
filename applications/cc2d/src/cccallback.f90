!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the cc2d-mini problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in "intf_xxxx.inc" files.
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Stokes
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc"
!#
!# 2.) coeff_Pressure
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the pressure matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc"
!#
!# 3.) coeff_RHS_x

!#
!# 4.) coeff_RHS_y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Y-velocity
!#        equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 5.) coeff_RHS_p
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the pressure/
!#        divergence equation.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 6.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_X
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in X-direction.
!#     -> Is one of two possibilities to set up the initial solution (the other one being
!#        cc_AnalyticSolution2_X).
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetX.
!#
!# 7.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_Y
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in Y-direction.
!#     -> Is one of two possibilities to set up the initial solution (the other one being
!#        cc_AnalyticSolution2_Y).
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetY.
!#
!# 8.) coeff_AnalyticSolution_P
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired pressure.
!#     -> Is one of two possibilities to set up the initial solution (the other one being
!#        cc_AnalyticSolution2_P).
!#     -> In the basic implementation, this calls ffunction_TargetP.
!#
!# 9.) ffunction_TargetX
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in X-direction.
!#     -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 10.) ffunction_TargetY
!#      -> Returns analytical values for the desired flow field in Y-direction.
!#      -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#      -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#         "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 11.) ffunction_TargetP
!#      -> Returns analytical values for the desired pressure.
!#      -> Is used for error analysis during the postprocessing.
!#      -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#         "intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc"
!#
!# 12.) getBoundaryValues
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#
!# 13.) getBoundaryValuesFBC
!#     -> Returns analytical values on the fictitious boundary components
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        "intf_fbcassembly.inc"
!#
!# 14.) cc_initCollectForAssembly
!#     -> Is called prior to the assembly process.
!#     -> Stores some information from the problem structure to a collection
!#        such that it can be accessed in callback routines
!#
!# 15.) cc_doneCollectForAssembly
!#      -> Is called after the assembly process.
!#      -> Releases information stored in the collection by
!#         cc_initCollectForAssembly.
!#
!# 16.) getMovingFrameVelocity
!#      -> If the moving frame formulation is activated, this routine
!#         returns the velocity and acceleration of the moving frame.
!#
!# 17.) getNonconstantViscosity
!#      -> If nonconstant viscosity is activated, this routine calculates
!#         the viscosity.
!#
!# 18.) calcAdaptiveTimestep
!#      -> Calculate a user defined timestep length.
!#
!# For nonstationary simulation, it might be neccessary in these routines
!# to access the current simulation time. Before the assembly process, the cc2d
!# framework calls cc_initCollectForAssembly to store the current point
!# in time (and probably other necessary information) to the quickaccess-array
!# in the collection which is passed to the callback routines. The callback
!# routines can access this as follows:
!#
!# -> rcollection%IquickAccess(1)   = 0: stationary,
!#                                    1: nonstationary with explicit time stepping
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(1)   = current simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(2)   = minimum simulation time
!# -> rcollection%DquickAccess(3)   = maximum simulation time
!#
!# After the assembly, cc_doneCollectForAssembly is called to clean up.
!# Note: Information stored in the quick-access array are of temporary
!# nature and does not have to be cleaned up.
!#
!#  EXAMPLES
!# ------------------------
!# 1.) Moving frames formulation
!#
!#   The moving frames formulation realises a moving domain, which is equivalent
!#   to the Lagrangian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation. It can be
!#   used e.g. to track falling particles in an infinite long channel or similar.
!#   The moving frames formulation is realised as follows:
!#
!#   Let us assume, the domain moves with velocity v=(vx,vy) and accelleration
!#   a=(ax,ay). This information must be returned by the function
!#   getMovingFrameVelocity below. To activate the moving frame formulation,
!#   the parameter imovingFrame in discretisation.dat must be set to 1.
!#   Then, the equation is changed as follows:
!#
!#     (Navier-)Stokes (u,p) = f + a
!#     div(u)                = 0
!#
!#     u(Dirichlet-boundary) = u0 + v
!#
!#   The velocity v is substracted from the postprocessing data to give
!#   nice pictures. Both, v and a, can be accessed in the boundary condition
!#   expressions (like L,R,S,x,y,TIME) as:
!#
!#     MFVELX = x-velocity
!#     MFVELY = y-velocity
!#     MFACCX = x-acceleration
!#     MFACCY = y-acceleration
!#
!#   You can for example generate a simple fixed particle in a moving
!#   bench1-channel by adding the following code to getMovingFrameVelocity:
!#
!#     Dvelocity(1) = 0.3_DP*(tanh(dtime))
!#     Dacceleration(1) = 0.3_DP*(1.0_DP-tanh(dtime)**2)
!#
!#   and the following data to the master.dat file.

  ! Is called by the framework to calculate a new timestep size if

    ! Current implementation: No nothing.
