# Default behaviour:
# Do not store object files to home directory, but to some scratch area
# without quota restrictions. Try to come up with a reasonable name for the
# object file directories (per application and one for the libraries which are
# shared among all FEAT2 applications).
#
# Note: this default behaviour can always be overridden by explicitly setting
# --objdir=<some path> on the command line when invoking this script!
#
# Specify its directory prefix here.
BASEDIR_OBJFILES=${HOME}/nobackup/feat2obj

# To support multiple working copies of FEAT2 which all store their object
# files beneath ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}, but which should not interfere which each
# other, duplicate the hierarchy of these FEAT2 installations beneath
# ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}. The procedure can be explained most easily with an
# example:
# Consider you have two FEAT2 installations, one in $HOME/Featflow2 and
# another in $HOME/Featflow2-testing, then the object files should go to
# ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}/Featflow2 and ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}/Featflow2-testing,
# respectively.
CWD=`/bin/pwd`

# Try to shorten the directory hierarchy below ${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}. Why?
# Because it is used to create the object directory and some compilers enforce
# (silently) restrictions on include and module directories (e.g. PGI). Do not
# let the path to object directory become too long!

# Step 1:
#   try to cut off the leading part ending in your username.
FEAT2INSTDIR=${CWD}
# $USER is used later on, but not all Unix systems define
# this environment variable, Sun Solaris e.g. does not.
test -z "$USER" && USER="$LOGNAME"
# Username contained in path name?
FEAT2INSTDIR=`echo ${FEAT2INSTDIR} | sed "s/^.*\/$USER\//\//;"`;

# Step 2:
#   remove "Featflow2/" and "Featflow2.gitsvn", case-insensitively
FEAT2INSTDIR=`echo ${FEAT2INSTDIR} | sed "s/\/Featflow2\//\//i; s/\/Featflow2.gitsvn\//\//i; "`;

# Concatenate directory strings to come up with a directory name
# for FEAT2 application object files
OBJDIRPREFIX=${BASEDIR_OBJFILES}${FEAT2INSTDIR}

# Create a likewise directory for all libraries which should
# be shared among all FEAT2 applications as - being a library -
# they have no dependency on the FEAT2 kernel or a FEAT2y application
# and are all compiled with identical settings.
