<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h1>Mounting Files</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>This document contrasts two methods for mounting an hdf5 file
      on another hdf5 file: the case where the relationship between
      files is a tree and the case where it's a graph.  The tree case
      simplifies current working group functions and allows symbolic
      links to point into ancestor files whereas the graph case is
      more consistent with the organization of groups within a
      particular file.

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <p>If file <code>child</code> is mounted on file
      <code>parent</code> at group <code>/mnt</code> in
      <code>parent</code> then the contents of the root group of
      <code>child</code> will appear in the group <code>/mnt</code> of
      <code>parent</code>. The group <code>/mnt</code> is called the
      <em>mount point</em> of the child in the parent.

    <h2>Common Features</h2>

    <p>These features are common to both mounting schemes.

    <ul>
      <li>The previous contents of <code>/mnt</code> in
	<code>parent</code> is temporarily hidden.  If objects in that
	group had names from other groups then the objects will still
	be visible by those other names.

      <li>The mount point is actually an OID (not a name) so if there
	are other names besides <code>/mnt</code> for that group then
	the root group of the child will be visible in all those
	names.

      <li>At most one file can be mounted per mount point but a parent 
	can have any number of mounted children.

      <li>Name lookups will entail a search through the mount table at
	each stage of the lookup.  The search will be O(log
	<em>N</em>) where <em>N</em> is the number of children mounted
	on that file.

      <li>Files open for read-only can be mounted on other files that
	are open for read-only.  Mounting a file in no way changes the
	contents of the file.

      <li>Mounting a child may hide mount points that exist below the
	child's mount point, but it does not otherwise affect mounted
	files.

      <li>Hard links cannot cross file boundaries.  An object cannot
	be moved or renamed with <code>H5Gmove()</code> in such a way
	that the new location would be in a different file than the
	original location.

      <li>The child can be accessed in a manner different from the
	parent. For instance, a read-write child in a read-only
	parent, a parallel child in a serial parent, <em>etc</em>.

      <li>If some object in the child is open and the child is
	unmounted and/or closed, the object will remain open and
	accessible until explicitly closed. As in the mountless case,
	the underlying UNIX file will be held open until all member
	objects are closed.

      <li>Current working groups that point into a child will remain
	open and usable even after the child has been unmounted and/or 
	closed.

      <li>Datasets that share a committed datatype must reside in the 
	same file as the datatype.

    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>A file <code>eos.h5</code> contains data which is constant for
      all problems.  The output of a particular physics application is
      dumped into <code>data1.h5</code> and <code>data2.h5</code> and
      the physics expects various constants from <code>eos.h5</code>
      in the <code>eos</code> group of the two data files.  Instead of
      copying the contents of <code>eos.h5</code> into every physics
      output file we simply mount <code>eos.h5</code> as a read-only
      child of <code>data1.h5</code> and <code>data2.h5</code>.
