<blockquote>
<strong>A Note to the Reader:</strong>
The primary HDF5 user documents are the online HTML documents
distributed with the HDF5 code and binaries and found on the HDF5 website.
These PDF and PostScript versions are generated from the HTML to provide
the following capabilites:
<ul>
<li>To provide a version that can be reasonably printed in a 
    single print operation.
<li>To provide an easily searchable version.
</ul>
In this package, you will find four PDF and PostScript documents:
<ul>
<li><cite>Introduction to HDF5</cite>
<li><cite>A User's Guide for HDF5</cite>
<li><cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite>
<li>All three of the above documents concatenated into a single file
</ul>
Note that these versions were created in response to user feedback;
the HDF Group is eager to hear from you so as to improve the delivered 
product.
