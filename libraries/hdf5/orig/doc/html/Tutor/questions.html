<h3>Section 2: HDF File Organization</h3>

<ol>
<li>Name and describe the two primary objects that can be stored in an HDF5
   file.

<p>
<li>What is an attribute?

<p>
<li>Give the path name for an object called <code>harry</code> that is a member of a
   group called <code>dick</code>, which, in turn, is a member of the root group.
</ol>


<h3>Section 3: The HDF5 API</h3>

<ol>
<li>Describe the purpose of each of the following HDF5 APIs:
    <dir>
    H5A, H5D, H5E, H5F, H5G, H5T, H5Z
    </dir>
</ol>


<h3>Section 4: Creating an HDF5 File</h3>

<ol>
<li>What two HDF5 routines must be called to create an HDF5 file?

<p>
<li>What include file must be included in any file that uses the HDF5 library?

<p>
<li>An HDF5 file is never completely empty because as soon as it is created,
   it automatically contains a certain primary object.  What is that object?
</ol>


<h3>Section 5: Creating a Dataset</h3>

<ol>
<li>Name and describe two major datatype categories.

<p>
<li>List the HDF5 atomic datatypes. Give an example of a predefined datatype.

<p>
<li>What does the dataspace describe? What are the major characteristics of 
   the simple dataspace? 

<p>
<li>What information needs to be passed to the <code>H5Dcreate</code> 
   function, i.e., what information is needed to describe a dataset at 
   creation time?
</ol>


<h3>Section 6: Reading from and Writing to a Dataset</h3>

<ol>
<li>What are six pieces of information which need to be specified for
   reading and writing a dataset?

<p>
<li>Why are both the memory dataspace and file dataspace needed for 
   read/write operations, while only the memory datatype is required?

<p>
<li>What does the line 
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <code>DATASPACE { SIMPLE (4 , 6 ) / ( 4 , 6 ) } </code> 
    <br>in Figure 6.1 mean?
</ol>


<h3>Section 7: Creating an Attribute</h3>

<ol>
<li>What is an attribute?

<p>
<li>Can partial I/O operations be performed on attributes?
</ol>


<h3>Section 8: Creating a Group</h3>

<ol>
<li>What are the two primary objects that can be included in a group?
</ol>


<h3>Section 9: Creating Groups Using Absolute and Relative Names</h3>

<ol>
<li>Group names can be specified in two ways.  What are these two types 
   of group names?

<p>
<li>You have a dataset named <code>moo</code> in the group <code>boo</code>, which is 
   in the group <code>foo</code>, which, in turn, is in the root group.  
   How would you specify an absolute name to access this dataset?
</ol>


<h3>Section 10: Creating Datasets in Groups</h3>

<ol>
<li>Describe a way to access the dataset <code>moo</code> described in the 
previous section (Section&nbsp;9, question&nbsp;2) using a relative name.
Describe a way to access the same dataset using an absolute name.
</ol>
