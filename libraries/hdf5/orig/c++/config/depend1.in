## We keep a list of dependencies in `.depend' for each of the source
## files on which it depends.  When one of the source files is modified
## we remove its record from .depend and regenerate its dependencies,
## tacking them onto the end of .depend.  By including the .depend file
## into the makefile, we're telling make that the makefile depends on
## the dependency list in the .depend file.
##
## This is as fast as the `.d' method described in the GNU make manual
## for automatic dependencies, but has the added advantage that all
## dependencies are stored in one place.  The advantage over the
## `makedepend' program is that only those files that are out of date
## have dependency information rebuilt, and the Makefile is not
## modified.
##
## This is also where tracing information is updated.  The $(TRACE)
## program is run on each source file to make sure that the H5TRACE()
## macros are up to date.  If they are then the file is not modified,
## otherwise the file is changed and a backup is saved by appending a
## tilde to the file name.
