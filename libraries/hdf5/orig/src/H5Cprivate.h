/****************************************************************************
 *
 * structure H5C_cache_entry_t
 *
 * Instances of the H5C_cache_entry_t structure are used to store cache
 * entries in a hash table and sometimes in a skip list.
 * See H5SL.c for the particulars of the skip list.
 *
 * In typical application, this structure is the first field in a
 * structure to be cached.  For historical reasons, the external module
 * is responsible for managing the is_dirty field.  All other fields are
 * managed by the cache.
 *
 * The fields of this structure are discussed individually below:
 *
 *						JRM - 4/26/04
 *
 * addr:	Base address of the cache entry on disk.
 *
 * size:	Length of the cache entry on disk.  Note that unlike normal
 *		caches, the entries in this cache are of variable length.
 *		The entries should never overlap, and when we do writebacks,
 *		we will want to writeback adjacent entries where possible.
 *
 * type:	Pointer to the instance of H5C_class_t containing pointers
 *		to the methods for cache entries of the current type.  This
 *		field should be NULL when the instance of H5C_cache_entry_t
 *		is not in use.
 *
 *		The name is not particularly descriptive, but is retained
 *		to avoid changes in existing code.
 *
 * is_dirty:	Boolean flag indicating whether the contents of the cache
 *		entry has been modified since the last time it was written
 *		to disk.
 *
 *		NOTE: For historical reasons, this field is not maintained
 *		      by the cache.  Instead, the module using the cache
 *		      sets this flag when it modifies the entry, and the
 *		      flush and clear functions supplied by that module
 *		      reset the dirty when appropriate.
 *
 *		      This is a bit quirky, so we may want to change this
 *		      someday.  However it will require a change in the
 *		      cache interface.
 *
 * is_protected: Boolean flag indicating whether this entry is protected
 *		(or locked, to use more conventional terms).  When it is
 *		protected, the entry cannot be flushed or accessed until
 *		it is unprotected (or unlocked -- again to use more
 *		conventional terms).
 *
 *		Note that protected entries are removed from the LRU lists
 *		and inserted on the protected list.
 *
 * in_slist:	Boolean flag indicating whether the entry is in the skip list
 *		As a general rule, entries are placed in the list when they
 *              are marked dirty.  However they may remain in the list after
 *              being flushed.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting the hash table:
 *
 * Fields in the cache are indexed by a more or less conventional hash table.
 * If there are multiple entries in any hash bin, they are stored in a doubly
 * linked list.
 *
 * ht_next:	Next pointer used by the hash table to store multiple
 *		entries in a single hash bin.  This field points to the
 *		next entry in the doubly linked list of entries in the
 *		hash bin, or NULL if there is no next entry.
 *
 * ht_prev:     Prev pointer used by the hash table to store multiple
 *              entries in a single hash bin.  This field points to the
 *              previous entry in the doubly linked list of entries in
 *		the hash bin, or NULL if there is no previuos entry.
 *
 *
 * Fields supporting replacement policies:
 *
 * The cache must have a replacement policy, and it will usually be
 * necessary for this structure to contain fields supporting that policy.
 *
 * While there has been interest in several replacement policies for
 * this cache, the initial development schedule is tight.  Thus I have
 * elected to support only a modified LRU policy for the first cut.
 *
 * When additional replacement policies are added, the fields in this
 * section will be used in different ways or not at all.  Thus the
 * documentation of these fields is repeated for each replacement policy.
 *
 * Modified LRU:
 *
 * When operating in parallel mode, we must ensure that a read does not
 * cause a write.  If it does, the process will hang, as the write will
 * be collective and the other processes will not know to participate.
 *
 * To deal with this issue, I have modified the usual LRU policy by adding
 * clean and dirty LRU lists to the usual LRU list.  When reading in
 * parallel mode, we evict from the clean LRU list only.  This implies
 * that we must try to ensure that the clean LRU list is reasonably well
 * stocked.  See the comments on H5C_t in H5C.c for more details.
 *
 * Note that even if we start with a completely clean cache, a sequence
 * of protects without unprotects can empty the clean LRU list.  In this
 * case, the cache must grow temporarily.  At the next write, we will
 * attempt to evict enough entries to get the cache down to its nominal
 * maximum size.
 *
 * The use of the replacement policy fields under the Modified LRU policy
 * is discussed below:
 *
 * next:	Next pointer in either the LRU or the protected list,
 *		depending on the current value of protected.  If there
 *		is no next entry on the list, this field should be set
 *		to NULL.
 *
 * prev:	Prev pointer in either the LRU or the protected list,
 *		depending on the current value of protected.  If there
 *		is no previous entry on the list, this field should be
 *		set to NULL.
 *
 * aux_next:	Next pointer on either the clean or dirty LRU lists.
 *		This entry should be NULL when protected is true.  When
 *		protected is false, and dirty is true, it should point
 *		to the next item on the dirty LRU list.  When protected
 *		is false, and dirty is false, it should point to the
 *		next item on the clean LRU list.  In either case, when
 *		there is no next item, it should be NULL.
 *
 * aux_prev:	Previous pointer on either the clean or dirty LRU lists.
 *		This entry should be NULL when protected is true.  When
 *		protected is false, and dirty is true, it should point
 *		to the previous item on the dirty LRU list.  When protected
 *		is false, and dirty is false, it should point to the
 *		previous item on the clean LRU list.  In either case, when
 *		there is no previous item, it should be NULL.
 *
 *
 * Cache entry stats collection fields:
 *
 * These fields should only be compiled in when both H5C_COLLECT_CACHE_STATS
 * and H5C_COLLECT_CACHE_ENTRY_STATS are true.  When present, they allow
 * collection of statistics on individual cache entries.
 *
 * accesses:	int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *		been referenced in its lifetime.
 *
 * clears:	int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *              been cleared in its life time.
 *
 * flushes:	int32_t containing the number of times this cache entry has
 *              been flushed to file in its life time.
