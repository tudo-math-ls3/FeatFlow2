## The libh5test.a library provides common support code for the tests. We link
## this library statically because some systems can only link executables to
## a single shared library and libhdf5 is much bigger than libh5test.

## HDF5_NOCLEANUP environment variable and running `make test' without
## specifying a file prefix or low-level driver.  Changing the file
## prefix or low-level driver with environment variables will influence 
## the temporary file name in ways that the makefile is not aware of.

## Source and object files for programs...  The TEST_SRC list contains all the
## source files and is used for things like dependencies, archiving, etc.  The
## other source lists are for the individual tests, the files of which may
## overlap with other tests.
