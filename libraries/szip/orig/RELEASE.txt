                      Relase notes for SZIP 2.0
                          February, 2005


Bug fixes:

   -- Few bugs that caused overflow of the output buffer were fixed.

New features:

   -- For information about changes in the SZIP source code see
      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/Release_notes_2_0.pdf
   -- This release supports shared libraries. 
      See "Known problems" section for additional information.

Know problems:

   -- On IRIX64-6.5 shared library version 3.0 is created instead of 2.0
   -- On AIX 5.1 shared library is built but not installed. To bypass
      the problem modify libsz.la in the src/.libs directory: 
      replace line #11 
          library_names='libsz.a libsz.a' 
      with
          library_names='libsz.so.2' 

      before running "make install"
