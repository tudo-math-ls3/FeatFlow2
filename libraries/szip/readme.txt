The following changes have been made in contrast to the original SZIP library:

- The source files have been moved into the "src" directory.
- The header files have been moved into the "include" directory.
- All unnecessary subfolders and the old makefile have been moved to
  the "orig" folder.
- The makefile was rewritten in Feat-Style.
